# Cluster 1: Gap-Filler Minimalist

**Prevalence**: 38.8% of corpus (most common)

**Contribution logic**: "We don't know about X; this study tells us."

---

## Identifying Gap-Filler Articles

Your article is Gap-Filler if:
- The Theory section identifies an **empirical gap** the study fills
- Structure is **funnel-shaped** (broad context → specific gap)
- Theory is **balanced or substantive-heavy** (not theory-heavy)
- Subsections are **minimal** (0-2)
- The contribution is primarily **empirical** (documenting, describing)

## Introduction Signature

### Key Statistics
| Feature | Typical Value |
|---------|---------------|
| Word count | 600-750 words (shortest cluster) |
| Paragraphs | 4-5 |
| Opening move | Phenomenon-led (77%) |
| Data mention | Early (40% in first third) |
| Roadmap | Optional (40%) |

### Opening Move
**Use phenomenon-led opening** (77% of Gap-Fillers do this).

> "Tasked with protecting children from abuse and neglect, U.S. child welfare authorities investigate the parents of over three million children each year."

Avoid theory-led; the contribution isn't theoretical.

### Structure
1. **Opening** (1-2 sentences): State the phenomenon
2. **Context** (1 paragraph): Situate empirically, briefly note existing research
3. **Gap** (1 paragraph): "Yet we know less about..." / "Prior research focused on X, leaving Y unexplored"
4. **Data preview** (2-3 sentences): Mention data early
5. **Argument preview** (3-4 sentences): State findings concisely

### Data Mention
Mention data **early**—within the first 3 paragraphs. Gap-Filler articles are empirically grounded; readers want to know your evidence base.

> "Drawing on interviews with 83 poor mothers in [location], this study examines..."

### Tone
- Efficient, not elaborate
- Modest but clear claims
- Don't oversell; the findings speak for themselves

## Conclusion Signature

### Key Statistics
| Feature | Typical Value |
|---------|---------------|
| Word count | 1,200-1,400 words (longest relative to intro) |
| Paragraphs | 7-9 |
| Intro:Conclusion ratio | ~2.05x |
| Limitations | Present (74%) |
| Future directions | Present (77%) |

### Why Conclusions Are Long
Gap-Filler articles have modest introduction promises. The conclusion must **accumulate significance**—transforming empirical findings into broader import. This takes space.

### Structure
1. **Restatement opening** (1 paragraph): Return to puzzle
2. **Findings summary** (1-2 paragraphs): Recap key patterns
3. **Literature integration** (1-2 paragraphs): Connect to prior research
4. **Contribution claim** (1 paragraph): State what study adds
5. **Limitations** (1 paragraph): Bound the claims
6. **Implications** (1-2 paragraphs): Policy and/or theoretical
7. **Future directions** (1 paragraph): Next steps
8. **Coda** (2-3 sentences): Resonant closing

### Accumulating Significance
Since the introduction was modest, the conclusion must build significance:

> "These findings extend our understanding of [topic] in three ways. First, [contribution 1]. Second, [contribution 2]. Third, [contribution 3]. Together, they suggest that [broader implication]."

### Limitations
Include explicit limitations (74% do). Be honest but not self-undermining:

> "This study is limited to [population] in [context]. Whether these patterns hold for [other populations] remains an empirical question."

## Coherence Pattern

### Dominant Type
**Parallel (69%)**: Deliver what you promise. Gap-Filler promises are modest, so they're easy to keep.

### Deflation Risk
**Low (3%)**: Modest promises are hard to underdeliver on.

### Escalation
**Some (23%)**: Findings may exceed expectations. Frame as discovery:

> "Beyond documenting [stated goal], our data revealed [broader pattern], suggesting that..."

## Writing Checklist

### Introduction
- [ ] Open with phenomenon (not theory, not question)
- [ ] Mention data within first 3 paragraphs
- [ ] Keep under 750 words
- [ ] State the gap clearly but briefly
- [ ] Preview findings concisely

### Conclusion
- [ ] Plan for length (~1,200+ words)
- [ ] Open with restatement of puzzle
- [ ] Summarize findings without repeating Findings section
- [ ] Connect to prior literature
- [ ] Include limitations paragraph
- [ ] Include future directions
- [ ] Build significance through accumulation
- [ ] End with resonant coda, not limitations

### Coherence
- [ ] Introduction promises are modest
- [ ] Conclusion delivers on all promises
