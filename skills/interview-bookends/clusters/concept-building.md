# Cluster 3: Concept-Building Architect

**Prevalence**: 15.0% of corpus

**Contribution logic**: "Existing concepts fail; this article introduces a better one."

---

## Identifying Concept-Building Articles

Your article is Concept-Building if:
- The Theory section develops **new conceptual tools or typologies**
- You **introduce a new term** with definitional precision
- Structure is **building-blocks** (concept → concept → synthesis)
- Subsections are **moderate to heavy** (3-5+)
- Literature balance is **theory-heavy**
- You may include a **table or figure** presenting the new framework

## Introduction Signature

### Key Statistics
| Feature | Typical Value |
|---------|---------------|
| Word count | 800-1,000 words (longest cluster) |
| Paragraphs | 6-8 |
| Opening move | Phenomenon-led (78%) |
| Data mention | Late (33% in final third) |
| Roadmap | Higher rate (56%) |

### Opening Move
**Use phenomenon-led opening** (78%)—but with a conceptual motivation.

> "The unprecedented growth in rates of U.S. incarceration since the early 1970s has prompted scholars to rethink basic understandings of punishment, inequality, and the state."

The opening establishes the phenomenon, then pivots to the conceptual gap.

### Structure
1. **Opening** (1-2 sentences): State phenomenon/stakes
2. **Conceptual problem** (1-2 paragraphs): Show why existing concepts fail
3. **New concept introduction** (1 paragraph): Name and briefly define the new term
4. **Preview of concept development** (1 paragraph): How the concept will be developed
5. **Data preview** (2-3 sentences): Can come late
6. **Roadmap** (1 paragraph): Recommended for complex conceptual work

### Motivating Conceptual Need
The introduction must show **why existing concepts are inadequate**:

> "Existing concepts—burnout, disengagement, defection—fail to capture [specific inadequacy]. The catch-all of 'exit' obscures [what it obscures]."

This sets up the contribution: a new concept that does what existing ones don't.

### Introducing the New Concept
Name the concept clearly and define it precisely:

> "We introduce the concept of 'carceral creep' to describe [definition]. Unlike [existing term], this concept captures [distinctive feature]."

### Longer Introduction Justified
Concept-Building introductions are the longest because you must:
1. Establish the phenomenon
2. Show conceptual inadequacy
3. Introduce the new concept
4. Preview how it will be developed

## Conclusion Signature

### Key Statistics
| Feature | Typical Value |
|---------|---------------|
| Word count | 800-900 words |
| Paragraphs | 4-6 |
| Intro:Conclusion ratio | ~1.03x (nearly balanced) |
| Limitations | Lower (44%) |
| Future directions | Lower (56%) |

### Why Conclusions Are Shorter
The conceptual work is **front-loaded**. The introduction motivates the concept; the Theory section develops it; the Findings demonstrate it. By the conclusion, the concept is proven. The conclusion consolidates rather than expands.

### Structure
1. **Opening** (1 paragraph): Concept affirmation or summary
2. **Concept deployment** (1-2 paragraphs): Recap how concept illuminated findings
3. **Contribution claim** (1 paragraph): What concept adds to field
4. **Scope and applications** (1 paragraph): Where else concept applies
5. **Coda** (2-3 sentences): Resonant closing

### Opening Move
**Summary opening is more common** in Concept-Building (44% vs. 20% corpus average):

> "In identifying the systematic aspects of identity work, we have developed the concept of [X] to capture [Y]."

### Consolidating the Concept
The conclusion should affirm that the concept did analytic work:

> "The concept of [X] proved useful for understanding [phenomenon]. Unlike [existing concepts], it captured [specific insight]."

### Lower Limitations Rate
Concept-Building articles have lower limitations rates (44%). The focus is on affirming conceptual utility, not bounding claims.

## Coherence Pattern

### Dominant Type
**Mixed**: Parallel (44%), Bookends (22%), Deflators (22%)

### Deflation Risk
**Highest (22%)**: Ambitious conceptual promises are hardest to match.

**Warning signs**:
- Introduction promises a "new way of understanding" but findings show modest insight
- Concept is introduced grandly but only explains one pattern
- Existing concepts actually work fine for the data

### Avoiding Deflation
1. **Calibrate ambition**: Don't claim more than the concept delivers
2. **Show conceptual work**: Demonstrate what the concept captures that others don't
3. **Distinguish clearly**: Make the difference from existing concepts concrete

### Bookends Pattern
When it works, Concept-Building achieves **Bookends (22%)**:
- Introduction poses conceptual problem
- Conclusion resolves it with new concept affirmed

## Exemplar

**10.1093_socpro_spz013 (Carceral Creep)**

- **Introduction**: 861 words, stakes-led, introduces "carceral creep"
- **Theory section**: Building-blocks arc, table defining six stages
- **Conclusion**: 875 words, summary opening, concept deployed
- **Ratio**: 1.02 (balanced)
- **Coherence**: Bookends—opens with conceptual need, closes with concept affirmed

## Writing Checklist

### Introduction
- [ ] Longer introduction justified (800-1,000 words)
- [ ] Establish phenomenon/stakes
- [ ] Show why existing concepts fail
- [ ] Introduce new concept with precision
- [ ] Preview how concept will be developed
- [ ] Include roadmap (recommended)
- [ ] Data mention can be late

### Conclusion
- [ ] Plan for balanced length (~800-900 words)
- [ ] Open with summary or concept affirmation
- [ ] Consolidate concept's utility
- [ ] Distinguish from existing concepts
- [ ] Define scope of applicability
- [ ] May have lower limitations emphasis
- [ ] End with resonant affirmation of concept

### Coherence
