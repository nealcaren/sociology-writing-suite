# Phase 1: Introduction Drafting

You are drafting the introduction for a sociology interview article. Your goal is to **open the circuit**—establish stakes, identify the puzzle, and preview the contribution.

## Why This Phase Matters

The introduction is where authors position their contribution. It establishes the genre contract: "I will examine X using Y to illuminate Z." Everything that follows must honor this contract. A strong introduction makes the reader want to keep reading; a weak one loses them before the findings begin.

## Required Reading

Before drafting, review:
- `techniques/opening-moves.md` — The five opening move types
- `clusters/[relevant-cluster].md` — Cluster-specific guidance
- Phase 0 assessment — Cluster assignment and recommended approach

## The Introduction Formula

Most sociology interview article introductions contain these moves in roughly this order:

| Move | Function | Typical Length |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **HOOK** | Grab attention, establish stakes | 1-2 sentences |
| **CONTEXT** | Situate empirically | 1-2 paragraphs |
| **GAP/PUZZLE** | Identify what needs explaining | 1 paragraph |
| **DATA PREVIEW** | Introduce empirical approach | 2-4 sentences |
| **ARGUMENT PREVIEW** | State what paper will show | 2-4 sentences |
| **ROADMAP** | Outline paper structure | 0-1 paragraph (optional) |

Not every introduction includes every move, but the order is fairly consistent.

## Step 1: Choose Your Opening Move

Based on cluster assignment:

### Phenomenon-Led (74% of corpus)
Opens with an empirical statement about the world.

> "Neighborhood is an important theme in research on prisoner reentry and desistance from offending, but scholars and practitioners typically use this to refer to a single location."

**Best for**: Gap-Filler, Concept-Building, Synthesis

### Stakes-Led (11%)
Opens with an importance claim.

> "The unprecedented growth in rates of U.S. incarceration since the early 1970s has prompted scholars to rethink basic understandings of punishment, inequality, and the state."

**Best for**: Problem-Driven, Gap-Filler

### Case-Led (8%)
Opens with a concrete case or scene.

> "In Cleveland, Ohio, the federal Department of Justice declared that the city's police department engaged in a 'pattern or practice' of using excessive force."

**Best for**: Problem-Driven, Synthesis

### Theory-Led (6%)
Opens with a theoretical framework.

> "The concept of the 'glass cliff' refers to the tendency for women and racial/ethnic minorities to be appointed to leadership positions during times of crisis."

**Best for**: Theory-Extension (30% use this)

### Question-Led (1%)
Opens with a direct question.

> "How do people make sense of their reliance on unjust institutions?"

**Use sparingly**: Rare and can feel performative. Only use when the question is genuinely compelling.

## Step 2: Establish Context

After the opening move, situate the reader:

**Empirical context**: What is the phenomenon? Who is affected? What is the scope?
- Statistics, policy background, population characteristics
- Ground the abstract in concrete reality

**Scholarly context**: Where does this fit in the literature?
- Brief signaling of relevant traditions (save details for Theory section)
- Just enough to establish you know the field

**Length**: 1-2 paragraphs, ~150-250 words

## Step 3: Identify the Gap/Puzzle

This is the **turn**—the moment you identify what needs explaining.

### Gap-Filling Turn
> "Yet we know remarkably little about how [population] experiences [phenomenon]. Prior research has focused on [X], leaving [Y] unexplored."

### Extension Turn
> "While [framework] has illuminated [domain A], scholars have not applied it to [domain B], where [reasons it might operate differently]."

### Concept-Building Turn
> "Existing concepts—[X, Y, Z]—fail to capture [specific aspect]. This article introduces the concept of [new term] to address this gap."

### Synthesis Turn
> "These literatures have developed largely in isolation. By drawing them together, we can see [new insight]."

### Debate Turn
> "Scholars disagree about whether [X] or [Y] better explains [phenomenon]. This study adjudicates by examining [case]."

## Step 4: Preview Data and Argument

Briefly introduce your empirical approach and main claim:

**Data preview**:
> "Drawing on [N] in-depth interviews with [population] in [location], conducted between [dates]..."

**Argument preview**:
> "We argue that [main claim]. Specifically, we find that [finding 1], [finding 2], and [finding 3]."

Or:
> "This article makes three contributions: First, ... Second, ... Third, ..."

**Length**: 1 paragraph, ~100-150 words

## Step 5: Roadmap (Optional)

If the article is complex (multiple findings, synthesis of traditions), include a brief roadmap:

> "The article proceeds as follows. We first review [literature], developing our theoretical framework. We then describe our methods and setting. The findings section demonstrates [X]. We conclude by discussing implications for [Y]."

**When to skip**: If the structure is obvious (standard empirical article), the roadmap can feel formulaic. Use your judgment.

## Cluster-Specific Adjustments

### Gap-Filler
- Keep short: 600-750 words
- Mention data early (within first 3 paragraphs)
- Efficient positioning; don't overexplain

### Theory-Extension
- Consider theory-led opening
- Name the framework clearly
- Explain why extension to this domain matters

### Concept-Building
- Longer introduction justified: 800-1,000 words
- Motivate why existing concepts fail
- Introduce the new concept with precision
- Include roadmap

### Synthesis
- Name multiple traditions explicitly
- Preview the integration
- May be longer to set up connections

### Problem-Driven
- Stakes-led or case-led opening works well
- Policy context can dominate
- Connect to real-world urgency

## Prohibited Moves

- **Opening with "This paper argues..."** — Too abrupt; establish context first
- **Lengthy literature review in introduction** — Save for Theory section
- **Overpromising** — Don't claim more than findings deliver
- **"The literature has overlooked..."** — Without justifying why the overlooking matters
- **Detailed methods in introduction** — Save for Methods section

## Calibrating Ambition

Match introduction claims to conclusion capacity:

| If you promise... | Conclusion must deliver... |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| "Extends theory X" | Affirmation that X works in new domain |
| "Introduces concept Y" | Demonstration that Y does analytic work |
| "Connects literatures A and B" | Integration of both in interpretation |
| "Resolves debate" | Evidence favoring one position |

**The coherence rule**: Whatever the introduction promises, the conclusion must keep.

## Output

Provide:
1. **Complete introduction draft** (target word count based on cluster)
2. **Annotation** noting:
   - Opening move type used
   - Where the turn/gap occurs
   - Key promises made (for conclusion coherence check)
3. **Concerns or alternatives** if multiple approaches could work

## When You're Done

Return the draft to the orchestrator. **Pause** for user review before proceeding to conclusion drafting.
