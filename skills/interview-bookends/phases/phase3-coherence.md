# Phase 3: Coherence Check

You are reviewing the introduction and conclusion together to ensure they work as a unified rhetorical system.

## Why This Phase Matters

The introduction makes promises; the conclusion must keep them. Articles fail when these sections are written in isolation. This phase ensures the **circuit is closed**—that what opens in the introduction resolves in the conclusion.

## The Coherence Principle

From genre analysis of 80 sociology articles:

| Coherence Type | Frequency | Description | Assessment |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Parallel** | 66% | Conclusion delivers what intro promised | Normative |
| **Escalators** | 20% | Conclusion exceeds intro scope | Acceptable |
| **Bookends** | 8% | Strong mirror structure | Effective |
| **Deflators** | 6% | Conclusion falls short | Problematic |

**The goal**: Achieve Parallel, Escalators, or Bookends. Avoid Deflators.

## Step 1: Extract Promises from Introduction

Read the introduction and identify every promise made:

| Promise Type | Example | Conclusion Must Deliver |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| **Empirical claim** | "We examine how X experience Y" | Evidence about X's experience of Y |
| **Framework application** | "Using Z framework..." | Findings interpreted through Z |
| **New concept** | "We introduce the concept of Q" | Q demonstrated analytically |
| **Synthesis claim** | "Connecting A and B literatures" | Both A and B integrated |
| **Debate resolution** | "Adjudicating between X and Y" | Evidence favoring one position |
| **Scope claim** | "Among [population] in [context]" | Findings bounded to that scope |

**Create a promise inventory**:
1. List each promise
2. Note where in conclusion it's addressed
3. Flag any unaddressed promises

## Step 2: Verify Vocabulary Echoes

Key terms from the introduction should reappear in the conclusion. Check for:

**Concept vocabulary**:
- Does the same terminology appear? (e.g., "recognition," "legal cynicism")
- Are concepts used consistently?

**Phenomenon vocabulary**:
- Same population descriptors
- Same setting references

**Argument vocabulary**:
- Same mechanism names
- Same contribution framing

**Red flag**: If major terms from introduction don't appear in conclusion, the callback may be weak.

## Step 3: Assess Callback Quality

The callback is REQUIRED. Evaluate it on:

### Presence
- Does the conclusion explicitly return to introduction themes?
- Is there a moment where the reader recognizes "this is what we started with"?

### Strength
| Weak Callback | Strong Callback |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Vague thematic similarity | Explicit vocabulary echo |
| Different framing | Same puzzle, now resolved |
| New angle introduced | Completing the circuit |

### Placement
- Callbacks typically appear in the **opening paragraph** of conclusion (restatement)
- And in the **closing paragraph** (coda)
- Double callbacks (opening + closing) create Bookends effect

## Step 4: Check Promise-Delivery Alignment

For each promise, assess delivery:

| Promise | Delivered? | Assessment |
|---------|------------|------------|
| [Promise 1] | Yes/Partial/No | Notes |
| [Promise 2] | Yes/Partial/No | Notes |
| [Promise 3] | Yes/Partial/No | Notes |

### If All Promises Delivered → Parallel (good)
The article does what it says. This is normative and appropriate.

### If Conclusion Exceeds Promises → Escalators (acceptable)
The findings turned out bigger than anticipated. Frame as discovery, not overclaiming.

**Example escalation language**:
> "Beyond our initial focus on [X], the data revealed [broader pattern]..."
> "These findings have implications beyond [original scope], suggesting..."

### If Promises Underdelivered → Deflators (problematic)
Options:
1. **Revise introduction** to make more modest claims
2. **Strengthen conclusion** to deliver on promises
3. **Acknowledge explicitly** if scope narrowed during research

## Step 5: Assess Coherence Type

Based on your analysis, classify the draft:

### Parallel
- All promises delivered
- Vocabulary echoes present
- Callback present and effective
- **Verdict**: Ready for polish

### Escalators
- Promises delivered plus additional claims
- Conclusion makes broader contributions
- Escalation is justified and grounded
- **Verdict**: Acceptable if escalation is earned

### Bookends
- Strong mirror structure
- Opening image/question returns in closing
- Symmetrical feel
- **Verdict**: Highly effective when achieved

### Deflators
- One or more promises unaddressed
- Conclusion hedges relative to introduction
- Contribution feels smaller than promised
- **Verdict**: Requires revision

## Step 6: Specific Checks

### Contribution Match
| Introduction Claims | Conclusion Claims | Match? |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| [Contribution type] | [Contribution type] | Yes/No |

### Scope Match
| Introduction Scope | Conclusion Scope | Match? |
|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| [Population, context] | [Population, context] | Yes/No |

### Theory Match
| Introduction Frameworks | Conclusion Frameworks | Match? |
|------------------------|----------------------|--------|
| [Theories named] | [Theories integrated] | Yes/No |

## Revision Recommendations

If coherence issues found, provide specific guidance:

### For Weak Callbacks
- Add explicit return to introduction vocabulary
- Echo opening image in closing
- Reference the original puzzle directly

### For Unfulfilled Promises
- Either deliver in conclusion or revise introduction
- Don't leave promises hanging
- Acknowledge any scope changes explicitly

### For Deflation
- Strengthen conclusion claims if evidence supports
- Or moderate introduction claims if necessary
- Match ambition to capacity

### For Unearned Escalation
- Ground broader claims in evidence
- Use hedging language if appropriate
- Ensure escalation is warranted

## Output

Provide a **Coherence Memo** with:

1. **Promise Inventory**: List of all introduction promises
2. **Delivery Assessment**: Which promises delivered, which not
3. **Callback Evaluation**: Presence, strength, placement
4. **Coherence Classification**: Parallel/Escalators/Bookends/Deflators
5. **Revision Recommendations**: Specific changes needed
6. **Final Assessment**: Ready for submission or needs revision

## Coherence Checklist

Before finalizing, confirm:

- [ ] Every major promise in introduction is addressed in conclusion
- [ ] Key vocabulary from introduction appears in conclusion
- [ ] Callback is present and recognizable
- [ ] Conclusion scope matches introduction scope
- [ ] All frameworks/theories named in intro are integrated in conclusion
- [ ] Contribution type is consistent across sections
- [ ] No deflation (claims don't shrink)
- [ ] Any escalation is earned and grounded

## When You're Done

Return the coherence memo to the orchestrator with:
1. Overall assessment (Pass/Revise)
2. Specific revision instructions if needed
3. Confidence level in current draft

If revisions needed, cycle back to Phase 1 or 2 as appropriate.
