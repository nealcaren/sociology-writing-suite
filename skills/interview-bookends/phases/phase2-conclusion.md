# Phase 2: Conclusion Drafting

You are drafting the conclusion for a sociology interview article. Your goal is to **close the circuit**—resolve the puzzle, claim the contribution, and project significance.

## Why This Phase Matters

The conclusion is where articles deliver on their promises. It transforms specific findings into broader significance. A strong conclusion makes readers remember the article; a weak one leaves them wondering "so what?"

**Critical insight from genre analysis**: Conclusions are substantially longer than introductions (median 1,173 vs. 761 words, ratio 1.67). This is because conclusions must accomplish more rhetorical tasks.

## The Work Conclusions Must Do

| Task | Purpose | Typical Length |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Restate puzzle** | Remind reader of motivating question | 2-3 sentences |
| **Summarize findings** | Recap key discoveries | 1-2 paragraphs |
| **Claim contribution** | State what the article adds | 1 paragraph |
| **Integrate with literature** | Connect to prior work | 1-2 paragraphs |
| **Acknowledge limitations** | Bound the claims | 1 paragraph |
| **Project implications** | Draw out broader meaning | 1-2 paragraphs |
| **Future directions** | Point to next steps | 1 paragraph |
| **Coda** | Resonant closing | 2-4 sentences |

## Step 1: Choose Your Opening Move

Conclusions typically open with one of three moves:

### Restatement (71% of corpus)
Returns to the puzzle without explicit "we found" language.

> "For poor mothers, the reach of child welfare surveillance extends beyond a single agency. This study has examined how fears of CPS reporting shape interactions with surveilling institutions..."

### Summary (20%)
Opens with explicit findings recap.

> "This article has demonstrated that exit from high-intensity movements operates through multiple distinct mechanisms..."

### Integration (9%)
Opens with literature positioning.

> "Recent research in cultural and political sociology has emphasized the role of recognition in shaping institutional trust..."

**Recommendation**: Restatement is the default. Summary works for complex articles with many findings. Integration works for Synthesis articles.

## Step 2: Summarize Key Findings

Recap the main findings efficiently. This is NOT a rewrite of the Findings section—it's a distillation.

**Structure options**:

**Enumerated**:
> "Three key findings emerge from this analysis. First, [finding 1]. Second, [finding 2]. Third, [finding 3]."

**Narrative**:
> "The analysis reveals that [main claim]. Participants consistently [pattern 1], even as they [pattern 2]. This dynamic was shaped by [mechanism]."

**Length**: 150-250 words (1-2 paragraphs)

**Avoid**: Repeating quote-heavy prose from Findings. The conclusion uses author voice.

## Step 3: Claim the Contribution

State explicitly what the article adds to knowledge. Match to cluster type:

### Gap-Filler
> "This study contributes to our understanding of [topic] by documenting [empirical insight]. Prior research focused on [X]; we show that [Y]."

### Theory-Extension
> "These findings demonstrate the utility of [framework] for understanding [new domain]. The framework illuminates [specific insight] that prior approaches missed."

### Concept-Building
> "The concept of [new term] provides analytic leverage for understanding [phenomenon]. Unlike [existing concepts], it captures [distinctive feature]."

### Synthesis
> "By connecting [tradition A] and [tradition B], we reveal [integrated insight]. What appeared as separate phenomena are better understood as [unified process]."

### Problem-Driven
> "This analysis advances debates over [topic] by showing [resolution]. The evidence suggests that [position] is more accurate, but [nuance]."

## Step 4: Integrate with Prior Literature

Connect your findings to existing scholarship. This demonstrates you understand the field and positions your contribution within it.

**Approaches**:

**Confirming prior work**:
> "These findings align with [Author]'s argument that [claim]. We extend this insight by showing [extension]."

**Challenging prior work**:
> "Contrary to [Author]'s emphasis on [X], we find that [Y] plays a more central role. This suggests [implication]."

**Synthesizing**:
> "Our findings bridge [Scholar A]'s focus on [X] with [Scholar B]'s attention to [Y], revealing how [connection]."

**Length**: 1-2 paragraphs, including citations

## Step 5: Acknowledge Limitations

Limitations are expected (present in 69% of conclusions). Handle them confidently, not apologetically.

**What to acknowledge**:
- Sample characteristics (size, selection, demographics)
- Geographic/temporal scope
- Methodological constraints
- What you can and cannot claim causally

**What NOT to do**:
- Endless hedging
- Undermining your own contribution
- Listing every conceivable limitation
- Ending the conclusion with limitations

**Example**:
> "This study has limitations. Our sample of [N] [population] in [location] may not generalize to [other contexts]. We cannot establish causal ordering between [X and Y]. Future research with [different design] could address these constraints."

**Length**: 1 paragraph, ~100-150 words

## Step 6: Project Implications

Draw out what your findings mean beyond the immediate study. Options include:

**Theoretical implications**:
> "These findings suggest that theories of [topic] should attend more carefully to [factor]. The [mechanism] we identify may operate in other contexts where [conditions]."

**Policy implications**:
> "For practitioners, these findings suggest [recommendation]. Current policies that [X] may inadvertently [Y]."

**Broader significance**:
> "More broadly, this study illuminates [larger phenomenon]. As [trend] continues, understanding [mechanism] becomes increasingly important."

**Length**: 1-2 paragraphs

## Step 7: Point to Future Directions

Identify productive next steps. This is NOT a limitations dump—it's a research agenda.

**Strong future directions**:
- Build on your contribution ("Future research might examine whether [mechanism] operates similarly in [new context]")
- Address what you couldn't ("Longitudinal designs could establish [causal claim]")
- Extend the framework ("The concept of [X] could be applied to [Y]")

**Length**: 1 paragraph

## Step 8: Craft the Callback and Coda

**The callback** returns to the introduction—same themes, vocabulary, or images. This is REQUIRED (100% of articles have callbacks).

**Callback strategies**:
- Return to opening case or image
- Echo key vocabulary from introduction
- Answer the question posed in opening (if question-led)
- Complete the circuit explicitly

**The coda** provides resonant closure. Options:

**Clinching quote**:
> As Maria put it, "It's not that we don't trust them—it's that we can't afford to."

**Mic-drop sentence**:
> "What the literature calls 'exit' may be better understood as dispersal: the movement identity spreading into the broader world, carried by individuals who remain, in some fundamental sense, what the movement made them."

**Return to stakes**:
> "Understanding these dynamics is increasingly urgent as [trend] reshapes [domain]."

**Avoid ending with**:
- Limitations (too weak)
- Generic "more research is needed"
- Fading repetition of findings

## Cluster-Specific Adjustments

### Gap-Filler
- Longer conclusion (target 1,200-1,400 words)
- Accumulate significance from modest claims
- Emphasize implications to build contribution

### Theory-Extension
- Moderate length (1,000-1,200 words)
- Framework affirmation central
- May extend framework to additional domains

### Concept-Building
- Can be shorter if concept proven in Findings (~800-900 words)
- Consolidate concept's utility
- Define scope of concept applicability

### Synthesis
- Must return to each tradition named in intro
- No deflation—integration must be delivered
- Often longer due to multi-tradition integration

### Problem-Driven
- May escalate to broader policy implications
- Stakes-heavy closing
- Connect back to real-world urgency

## Output

Provide:
1. **Complete conclusion draft** (target word count based on cluster)
2. **Annotation** noting:
   - Opening move used
   - Where callback occurs
   - Key promises from intro that are addressed
   - Coherence type (Parallel, Escalators, Bookends)
3. **Coherence check** against introduction promises

## When You're Done

Return the draft to the orchestrator for coherence review in Phase 3.
