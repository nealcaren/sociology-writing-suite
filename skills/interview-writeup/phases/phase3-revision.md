# Phase 3: Revision & Quality Check

You are reviewing and refining the draft to meet publication standards. This phase catches formulaic writing, ensures analytical rigor, and verifies that the text reads as argument rather than transcript.

## Why This Phase Matters

First drafts often display evidence without arguing with it. Common problems include mechanical quote-analysis-quote patterns, hedging empirical claims, and letting quotes carry analytic weight. This phase transforms competent drafts into compelling arguments.

## Revision Priorities

Work through these checks in order. Earlier issues compound later ones.

---

### 1. Argument Structure

**Check the Roadmap**:
- [ ] Does the opening paragraph summarize the entire argument before showing evidence?
- [ ] Are all mechanisms/processes named upfront?
- [ ] Does the reader know where the section is going?

**Check Each Subsection**:
- [ ] Does it advance one clear analytic claim?
- [ ] Is that claim stated in the first 2-4 sentences (before any quotes)?
- [ ] Does the heading name a mechanism or process (not a topic)?
- [ ] Does the close connect forward to the next section?

**Red flags**:
- Opening with "We interviewed X people..." or "This section presents..."
- Subsections that list themes rather than advance arguments
- Headings like "Findings," "Race," "Gender," or "What Participants Said"

---

### 2. The Anchor-Echo Pattern

**For each subsection, verify**:
- [ ] There is one anchor vignette (2-3 paragraphs on a single participant)
- [ ] The anchor establishes social location before quoting
- [ ] The anchor quote is extended enough to show how they think (not just what)
- [ ] There are 2-3 echo quotes showing prevalence
- [ ] Echoes are shorter and punchier than the anchor

**Red flags**:
- All quotes treated equally (no depth variation)
- No clear anchor case
- Prevalence asserted but not demonstrated
- Participant introduced only by name, not situation

---

### 3. Quote Integration

**Check every quote**:
- [ ] Is it introduced with analytic framing (not just "X said")?
- [ ] Is it followed by explicit interpretation?
- [ ] Does the reader know what to listen for before it appears?
- [ ] Are consecutive quotes separated by analytical sentences?

**Red flags**:
- Quotes stacked back-to-back
- Neutral attributions: "Maria said...", "According to Steve..."
- Quotes that "speak for themselves" (no interpretation follows)
- Quotes introducing analytic novelty (the claim appears after, not before)

**The hamburger test**: If every quote follows the pattern [brief context] → [quote] → [analysis sentence], the prose is too formulaic. Look for:
- Embedded phrases woven into author sentences
- Anticipatory framing where the claim precedes the quote
- Varied quote lengths matched to purpose
- Pivot phrases elevated to conceptual anchors

---

### 4. Voice and Confidence

**Authorial voice should dominate**:
- [ ] Does the author's voice outweigh participant voice overall?
- [ ] Are causal claims made in sociological language (not respondent language)?
- [ ] Are mechanisms named by the author, not discovered in quotes?

**Check for inappropriate hedging**:
- [ ] Empirical patterns stated confidently ("This pattern emerged...") not tentatively ("This might suggest...")
- [ ] Theoretical scope hedged appropriately, but not empirical observations
- [ ] Confidence comes from patterning, not sample size apologetics

**Red flags**:
- "This may indicate..."
- "It could be interpreted as..."
- "Participants seemed to feel..."
- Over-reliance on participant voice for analytical claims

---

### 5. Variation Handling

**Check sequencing**:
- [ ] Is baseline pattern established before variation introduced?
- [ ] Is variation signaled explicitly ("However...", "In contrast...")?
- [ ] Is the axis of difference named (race, class, context)?
- [ ] Is variation explained (why it occurs), not just noted?

**Red flags**:
- Opening with difference ("Some said X while others said Y")
- Variation as exception dump (list of outliers)
- No explanation for why variation occurs

---

### 6. Scope and Prevalence

**Check prevalence indicators**:
- [ ] Is scope indicated throughout ("most," "nearly all," "across both sites")?
- [ ] Are vague quantifiers avoided ("some," "many," "few")?
- [ ] When numbers are used, is it clear they describe the sample (not the population)?

**Red flags**:
- "Some respondents said..."
- "Many participants felt..."
- No indication of how common a pattern is
- Numbers implying statistical representativeness

---

### 7. Methods Section (if included)

- [ ] Population explicitly defined (not vague)
- [ ] Sampling strategy named and justified
- [ ] Sample size justified through legitimate strategy
- [ ] Interview details specified (format, duration, topics)
- [ ] Analysis approach described
- [ ] Positionality addressed (when appropriate)

## Common Problems and Solutions

| Problem | Symptom | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Formulaic structure** | Every quote has identical setup-quote-analysis pattern | Vary integration: embed phrases, front-load claims, use pivot phrases |
| **Quotes speaking for themselves** | Quote followed by transition, not interpretation | Add 1-2 sentences naming what the quote shows |
| **Missing anchor** | All cases treated equally briefly | Pick one exemplary case, go deep (2-3 paragraphs) |
| **Stacked quotes** | Quote immediately follows quote | Insert analytical sentences between |
| **Weak attribution** | "Maria said..." | "Maria, a [demographics] in [situation], explained..." |
| **Descriptive headings** | "Race," "Findings," "Results" | Name the mechanism: "Racialized Pathways to..." |
| **Starting with variation** | "Some said X, others said Y" | Establish baseline first, then stratify |
| **Hedged empirics** | "This might suggest..." | "This pattern shows..." (hedge theory, not data) |
| **Topic headings** | "What Workers Said About Pay" | "Wage Theft as Normalized Exploitation" |
| **No roadmap** | Jumps straight into first subsection | Add 1-2 paragraph overview naming all mechanisms |

## Prohibited Moves Checklist

Verify the draft does **not**:

- [ ] Start any subsection with a quote
- [ ] List themes without argument
- [ ] Use quotes without interpretation
- [ ] Stack quotes back-to-back
- [ ] Hedge empirical patterns
- [ ] Use purely descriptive subheadings
- [ ] Let quotes introduce analytic novelty
- [ ] Treat all quotes with equal depth
- [ ] Start with variation before baseline
- [ ] Use neutral attribution when analytic framing is possible

---

## Quality Indicators

The final draft should demonstrate:

- **Argument over display**: Each subsection advances a claim, not just shows data
- **Analytical confidence**: Patterns stated assertively, mechanisms named clearly
- **Narrative craft**: Varied quote integration, anchor-echo pacing, smooth transitions
- **Grounded abstraction**: Sociological concepts tied to concrete evidence
- **Strategic depth**: Anchor cases developed fully, echoes efficient
