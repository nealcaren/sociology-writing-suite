# Phase 1: Methods Section

You are drafting or revising a methods section for interview-based research.

## Why This Phase Matters

Readers need to understand who you studied, how you recruited them, how you collected data, and how you analyzed it. Transparency is central to credibility.

## Required Elements

Ensure the methods section includes:

1. **Case Selection**: Who was interviewed and why (explicit criteria, not “diverse participants”).
2. **Sampling Strategy**: Named approach (purposive, snowball, theoretical, etc.) with justification.
3. **Recruitment**: How participants were contacted; response rate if known; gatekeeper roles.
4. **Sample Size Justification**: Use one of four legitimate strategies:
   - Comparative/structural logic
   - Population coverage
   - Saturation evidence (with documentation)
   - Pragmatic constraints with adequacy assessment
5. **Interview Protocol**: Format, duration, key topics, recording/transcription.
6. **Analysis Approach**: Coding process and iterative analysis.
7. **Positionality** (when relevant): Only if identity meaningfully shaped access or interpretation.

## Methods Template

```
This study draws on [N] semi-structured interviews with [population description]
conducted between [dates] in [location].

**Sampling and Recruitment.** [Target population definition]. We identified potential
participants through [sampling frame] using [strategy] because [justification].
Of [number contacted], [number agreed] ([%] response rate). [Gatekeeper roles or
recruitment challenges if applicable].

**Sample Characteristics.** The final sample included [key demographic breakdown
relevant to analysis]. [Sample size justification].

**Interview Procedures.** Interviews lasted [duration range] and covered [key topics].
All interviews were [recording method] and [transcription approach].

**Analysis.** We analyzed transcripts using [approach]. [Brief coding process].
Analysis was iterative, moving between data and emerging conceptual categories.
```

## Common Problems to Flag

- Vague population definitions (e.g., “diverse participants”)
- Arbitrary sample size justifications (“following conventions, we conducted 30 interviews”)
- Missing response rate information (when it can be reported)
- Excessive technical detail (software versions, device brands)
- Generic positionality statements without substantive content

## Output

Provide a draft or revised methods section plus a short list of gaps or questions for the user.

## When You’re Done

Return a summary to the orchestrator with:
1. Drafted methods text
2. Any missing details to request
3. Quality flags to address
