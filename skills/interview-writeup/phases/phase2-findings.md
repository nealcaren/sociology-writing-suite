# Phase 2: Findings Section

You are structuring and drafting the findings section. Your goal is to produce **argument-driven narrative**, not a catalog of themes with illustrative quotes.

## Why This Phase Matters

A strong findings section advances analytic claims using interview data. Quotes instantiate ideas already introduced by the author—they never carry analytic novelty on their own. The difference between a publishable findings section and a rough draft is often the difference between *arguing with evidence* and *displaying evidence*.

## Required Reading

Before drafting, review these technique guides:

1. **`techniques/macro-structure.md`** — Choose your archetype (Mechanism List, Comparative, or Process) and understand the Roadmap + Pillars model
2. **`techniques/prose-craft.md`** — Master the Anchor-Echo pattern, quote integration techniques, and pacing
3. **`techniques/rubric.md`** — Follow the 8-step process for each subsection
4. **`techniques/participant-management.md`** — Minimize recurrence; most participants appear in only one section

## Step 1: Choose Your Archetype

Based on the user's argument and data, select one:

| Archetype | Best For | Structure |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Mechanism List** | Distinct, non-linear findings | Mechanism 1 → Mechanism 2 → Mechanism 3 |
| **Comparative** | Contrasting groups or contexts | Group A → Group B → Explanation → Synthesis |
| **Process** | Trajectories over time/stages | Problem → Reaction → Justification/Outcome |

Confirm the choice with the user before proceeding.

## Step 2: Write the Roadmap Introduction

The Findings section does not "warm up." Draft a high-density Roadmap (1-2 paragraphs, 150-300 words) with this structure:

1. **Headline Sentence**: State the primary finding as fact, not process.
   - Bad: "We interviewed 50 people about disaster recovery."
   - Good: "Exit from high-intensity movements operates through multiple distinct mechanisms that the catch-all of 'burnout' obscures."

2. **Mechanism Summary**: 2-3 sentences listing the key themes of upcoming subsections.
   - Example: "We identify three pillars: (1) mechanisms of exhaustion, (2) structures of opportunity, and (3) persistence of identity."

3. **Signpost**: A final sentence transitioning to the first subsection.
   - Example: "The analysis below demonstrates how these pillars operated in sequence and interaction."

## Step 3: Draft Each Subsection

For each subsection, follow the 8-step rubric in `techniques/rubric.md`:

1. **Declare the analytic move** (internal—know what claim this section advances)
2. **Open with analytic assertion** (2-4 sentences, sociological voice, scope indicated)
3. **Elaborate the mechanism** (1-2 sentences on how/why)
4. **Introduce anchor quote with purpose** (explain what it will illustrate)
5. **Present the anchor quote** (extended, from one deep case)
6. **Interpret explicitly** (name what it shows, link to claim)
7. **Show prevalence with echo quotes** (2-3 shorter quotes from other participants)
8. **Manage variation and close** (if applicable; connect to next section)

### The Anchor-Echo Pattern

Every subsection needs:

**One Anchor** — Go deep on a single participant (2-3 paragraphs). Establish their social location, describe their specific experience, use an extended quote, interpret what the case shows.

**2-3 Echoes** — Zoom out to show this isn't idiosyncratic. Use shorter quotes, signal prevalence ("Other respondents echoed...", "This pattern held across...").

### Subsection Length

Target **600-900 words** per subsection. This is enough for:
- Analytic setup (100-150 words)
- Anchor vignette with quote and interpretation (300-400 words)
- Echo quotes with brief analysis (150-200 words)
- Variation handling and close (100-150 words)

## Step 4: Craft Theoretical Headings

Subheadings must name a **process or mechanism**, not a topic or demographic:

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "Race and Housing" | "Racialized Pathways to Residential Instability" |
| "What Workers Said" | "Recognition Estrangement and Invisible Labor" |
| "Findings on Trust" | "The Production of Institutional Distrust" |
| "Gender Differences" | "Gendered Strategies of Boundary Maintenance" |

## Step 5: Manage Participant Recurrence

**Default rule**: Each participant appears in only one section. Different sections use different people.

**Recurrence budget**: 1-2 participants maximum across the entire Findings section.

**When recurrence works**: Only when a participant's experience *organically spans multiple mechanisms*, showing how processes connect over time. The recurrence should *be* the finding—not just convenience.

**Tracking**: Maintain a list of which participants appear in which sections. Before adding someone as an echo, check if they've already been used.

**Recall tags**: When a participant does reappear, use a recall tag instead of repeating demographics:

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "Karl, a white gay man in his early twenties..." | "Karl, the floor facilitator discussed above..." |
| Full re-introduction | "Recalling Karl's earlier observation about 'volume eleven'..." |

See `techniques/participant-management.md` for detailed guidance.

## Step 6: Handle Variation Correctly

**Critical sequencing**: Establish baseline first, then stratify.

1. "Most participants reported..." (baseline)
2. "This pattern held across [demographic variations]..." (confirm generality)
3. "However, [specific group] diverged..." (introduce variation)
4. Evidence for variation
5. Explanation for why variation occurs

Never start with difference. Never treat variation as an exception dump.

## Quote Integration Reminders

From `techniques/prose-craft.md`:

- **Front-load analysis**: Readers should know what to listen for before the quote
- **Embed short phrases**: Weave participant language into your sentences for flow
- **Never stack quotes**: Analytical sentences must separate consecutive quotes
- **Long quotes need justification**: Use block quotes only when voice, narrative arc, or internal contradiction matters
- **Interpret every quote**: Never let a quote "speak for itself"

### Attribution

Every quoted participant needs situating:

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Maria said..." | "Maria, a 34-year-old single mother working two jobs, explained..." |
| "One respondent noted..." | "Illustrating this dynamic, Steve, a veteran employee passed over for promotion, recounted..." |

Use high-value verbs: explained, recounted, reasoned, emphasized, lamented, articulated, contended, justified.

## Scope and Prevalence

Indicate prevalence throughout—but naturally:

- "Most respondents..."
- "Nearly all participants..."
- "A minority of interviewees..."
- "Across both sites..."
- "Regardless of [demographic]..."

When precision matters, use numbers: "Twelve of our 24 respondents described..." But avoid disrupting narrative flow with excessive quantification.

## Prohibited Moves

Do **not**:
- Start any subsection with a quote
- List themes without argument
- Use quotes without interpretation
- Stack quotes back-to-back
- Hedge empirical patterns ("might suggest")
- Write descriptive subheadings ("Findings," "Race," "Results")
- Let quotes introduce analytic novelty
- Add a summary conclusion paragraph to the Findings section

## The Hard Stop Ending

The Findings section has **no separate conclusion**. It simply stops after the final thematic subsection is complete. The "Conclusion" or "Discussion" is a separate section that follows later.

End the final pillar with:
- **A clinching quote**: A powerful vignette that encapsulates the final point
- **A mic-drop sentence**: A final analytical sentence restating the significance

Example mic-drop: "What the literature calls 'exit' may be better understood as dispersal: the movement identity spreading out from the organization into the broader world, carried by individuals who remain, in some fundamental sense, what the movement made them."

Do **not** recap all the pillars at the end. That work belongs in the Discussion.

## Output

Provide:
- A complete findings section draft, or
- A detailed outline with the Roadmap paragraph drafted and each subsection sketched (anchor case identified, echo cases listed, analytic claim stated)

For each subsection, note:
- The analytic claim it advances
- The anchor participant and why they're exemplary
- The echo participants showing prevalence
- Any variation to be addressed
- Gaps in evidence (quotes needed but not yet available)

## When You're Done

Return a summary to the orchestrator with:
1. Chosen archetype and rationale
2. Drafted sections or detailed outline
3. Evidence gaps or missing quotes
4. Questions about scope, variation, or analytical framing
