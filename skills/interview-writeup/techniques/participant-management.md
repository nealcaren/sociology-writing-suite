# Participant Management: Recurrence and Attribution

## The Recurrence Problem

When the same participant appears in multiple sections, it can either strengthen the argument (showing how mechanisms connect) or weaken it (suggesting the sections aren't independent patterns). Most published articles **actively avoid recurrence** to preserve the sense that each section demonstrates a distinct phenomenon.

## The Rule: Minimize Strategic Recurrence

**Reuse rate**: Aim for 1-2 key participants across the entire Findings section, maximum.

**Default**: Each participant appears in only one section. Different sections use different people to demonstrate that patterns are general, not idiosyncratic to particular individuals.

## When Recurrence Works

Recurrence is appropriate when a participant's experience **organically spans multiple mechanisms**, allowing you to show how processes connect:

### Processual/Longitudinal Illustration

When showing movement over time or across domains, one participant can reappear to trace a trajectory:

> Example: Helen's experiences with FEMA appear in "Procedural Injustice," while related community dynamics reappear later as the paper moves toward "Vicarious Marginalization."

This works because Helen's story *is* the connection between mechanisms—her trajectory shows how procedural injustice produces community-level effects.

### Bookending

A participant who appears early can return at the end to show transformation or persistence:

> Example: The person who describes burning out ("volume eleven") later appears describing never truly leaving ("I don't think you ever get out"). The recurrence *is* the finding—exhaustion and identity persistence are linked.

## When to Avoid Recurrence

**Avoid recurrence when sections are analytically independent.** If each section demonstrates a distinct mechanism that operates separately, using different participants preserves that independence.

Signs you should NOT reuse a participant:
- The sections describe different groups (e.g., "UK Elites" vs. "Danish Elites")
- The mechanisms are conceptually separate (e.g., "Recognition," "Securing Work," "Managing Estrangement")
- Reusing would suggest the section is just "another reading" of the same person rather than a general pattern

## The Re-Introduction Tag

When a participant does reappear in a later section, **do not re-state their full demographics**. Use a recall tag instead:

### Bad (Repeated Demographics)

> "Karl, a white gay man in his early twenties who served as a floor facilitator, described..."

### Good (Recall Tag)

> "Karl, the floor facilitator whose pace exhaustion we examined earlier, also described..."

> "Recalling Karl's earlier observation about 'volume eleven,' his subsequent reflection reveals..."

> "Karl, introduced above as an example of pace exhaustion, reappears here in a different light..."

### Recall Tag Templates

- "[Name], the [brief role descriptor] discussed above..."
- "[Name], whose [earlier topic] we examined in the previous section..."
- "Recalling [Name]'s earlier observation about [topic]..."
- "As [Name] noted earlier regarding [topic], [new observation]..."
- "[Name], introduced above as [role], reappears here..."

## Practical Workflow

### During Drafting

1. **Track usage**: Keep a list of which participants appear in which sections
2. **Default to new people**: When you need an echo quote, first look for someone not yet used
3. **Reserve recurrence**: Save the 1-2 recurrence slots for cases that genuinely span mechanisms

### During Revision

1. **Audit recurrence**: Count how many participants appear in more than one section
2. **Justify each recurrence**: Can you articulate why this person needs to appear twice?
3. **Replace unjustified recurrences**: Find alternative participants who can serve the same function
4. **Fix attribution**: Ensure all reappearances use recall tags, not repeated demographics

## Example: Reducing Recurrence

**Before (4 recurring participants—too many):**

| Participant | Section 1 | Section 2 | Section 3 |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Karl | Anchor | — | Echo |
| Frank | Echo | — | Echo |
| Chip | Anchor | — | Anchor |
| Lei | — | Anchor, Echo | — |

**After (1 strategic recurrence):**

| Participant | Section 1 | Section 2 | Section 3 |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Karl | Anchor | — | — |
| Frank | Echo | — | — |
| Chip | Anchor | — | Anchor (with recall tag) |
| Lei | — | Anchor | — |
| Gregg | — | Echo | — |
| Joy | — | — | Anchor |
| Moises | — | — | Echo |

Chip's recurrence is strategic: it connects exhaustion to identity persistence. Everyone else appears once.
