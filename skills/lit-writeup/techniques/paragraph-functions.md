# Paragraph Functions

Every paragraph in a Theory section serves a recognizable function. Readers should be able to identify what each paragraph is *doing* even without subheadings. This guide catalogs the 9 primary paragraph functions.

## The 9 Functions

| Function | Purpose | Typical Position |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| **PROVIDE_CONTEXT** | Establish phenomenon, population, or setting | Early; often opens section |
| **DESCRIBE_THEORY** | Explicate a theoretical framework or concept | After context; throughout |
| **SYNTHESIZE** | Summarize patterns across multiple studies | Middle; builds cumulative case |
| **CONTRAST** | Present competing positions or perspectives | Middle; debate framing |
| **CRITIQUE** | Identify limitations of existing approaches | Before gap or new concept |
| **IDENTIFY_GAP** | Mark what remains unknown or unstudied | Middle; the "turn" |
| **BRIDGE** | Connect literatures or show how framework applies | After gap; synthesis payoff |
| **STATE_QUESTIONS** | Articulate research questions or previews | Late; often closes section |
| **PREVIEW** | Summarize what's coming in the findings | Final paragraph |

## Detailed Function Profiles

### PROVIDE_CONTEXT

**Purpose**: Ground the reader in the empirical world—the phenomenon, population, setting, or historical moment under study.

**Typical markers**:
- Opens with phenomena, not scholars
- Statistics, trends, or historical developments
- "As [condition] has [changed]..."
- "The [phenomenon] affects..."
- "In [year/decade], [development]..."

**Example paragraph**:
> As housing costs have outpaced wage growth, many parents face difficulty housing their families. Over 3 million households with children doubled up with friends or family in 2019, and doubling-up rates have risen since the Great Recession. Low-income and Black families are disproportionately likely to double up, often as a strategy to avoid homelessness or manage poverty.

**When to use**: Opening the section; grounding each subsection in empirical reality.

---

### DESCRIBE_THEORY

**Purpose**: Explicate a theoretical framework, concept, or key term. Make the analytical tool available to the reader.

**Typical markers**:
- Names a theorist, framework, or concept explicitly
- Uses "According to," "[Scholar] argues," "The concept of [X]..."
- Explains *how* the concept works, not just what it is
- May include definition, dimensions, mechanisms

**Example paragraph**:
> The concept of "recognition" draws on several conceptual traditions. According to Honneth (2003), recognition operates through three spheres: love (intimate relationships), rights (legal status), and esteem (social value). When individuals are denied recognition—through disrespect, exclusion, or degradation—they experience psychological harm and may struggle to develop positive self-relations. Recognition thus serves as both a psychological resource and a political demand.

**When to use**: After context; whenever introducing theoretical apparatus.

---

### SYNTHESIZE

**Purpose**: Pull together findings from multiple studies to establish patterns, consensus, or accumulated knowledge.

**Typical markers**:
- Multiple citations in a single paragraph
- "Studies find..." "Research shows..." "Scholars have documented..."
- Aggregates findings rather than describing individual studies
- Builds toward a cumulative claim

**Example paragraph**:
> Research on legal cynicism demonstrates that distrust of legal institutions is patterned by neighborhood context, race, and prior contact with police (Kirk and Papachristos 2011; Sampson and Bartusch 1998). Studies consistently find that residents of high-crime neighborhoods express cynicism about police responsiveness and fairness, even as they continue to call 911 for emergencies (Desmond et al. 2016). This literature highlights the coexistence of cynicism and reliance—a paradox that existing frameworks have struggled to explain.

**When to use**: Building the evidence base before identifying the gap; showing what "we know."

---

### CONTRAST

**Purpose**: Present competing perspectives, alternative explanations, or disagreement in the literature.

**Typical markers**:
- "However," "In contrast," "Others argue..."
- Two (or more) positions clearly delineated
- Even-handed presentation (for Debate-Resolvers)
- May set up a tension the study will address

**Example paragraph**:
> Whether secondary labor market entry helps or harms long-term immigrant incorporation remains debated. One line of research suggests that early employment—even in low-wage jobs—provides social capital, language acquisition, and pathway to better positions (Portes and Rumbaut 2001). Others, however, argue that secondary labor market entry traps immigrants in dead-end jobs, limiting mobility and reinforcing ethnic segmentation (Waldinger and Lichter 2003). This tension remains unresolved in the literature.

**When to use**: Problem-Driven (Debate) articles; showing disagreement before resolution.

---

### CRITIQUE

**Purpose**: Identify limitations, blind spots, or inadequacies in existing approaches.

**Typical markers**:
- "However, this approach is limited..."
- "Yet scholars have not..."
- "This framework cannot account for..."
- "Existing literature is limited on two fronts..."

**Example paragraph**:
> While this work is valuable for understanding how individuals navigate bureaucratic encounters, it is limited in two respects. First, most studies focus on formal legal settings (courts, police stations), overlooking everyday interactions with social services. Second, the literature assumes that individuals approach institutions with formed dispositions, neglecting how dispositions themselves may be shaped through repeated encounters. A more dynamic account is needed.

**When to use**: Concept-Builders before introducing new framework; setting up the need for innovation.

---

### IDENTIFY_GAP

**Purpose**: Mark the transition from "what we know" to "what we don't know." This is the rhetorical center of the section.

**Typical markers**:
- "Yet we know little about..."
- "However, less attention has been paid to..."
- "What remains unclear is..."
- "Scholars have not examined..."
- "Largely unexplored are..."

**Example paragraph**:
> Yet while research to date provides insight into *why* residents persist in calling on law enforcement despite cynicism, there is less attention to the cultural scripts through which people themselves seek to *make sense* of the institutions with which they engage. How do residents of high-crime neighborhoods understand their relationship to police? What meaning-making processes allow them to reconcile cynicism with reliance? These questions remain largely unexplored.

**When to use**: The "turn" moment. Usually middle of the section; sometimes later for empirical documenters.

---

### BRIDGE

**Purpose**: Connect what has been established to what you're doing. Show how literatures come together or how frameworks apply.

**Typical markers**:
- "Bringing together..." "Drawing on..."
- "This framework illuminates..."
- "We argue that [X] provides analytical purchase on..."
- "These insights suggest that..."

**Example paragraph**:
> Bringing these literatures into dialogue suggests a way forward. Recognition theory illuminates why procedural fairness matters—it signals respect and acknowledgment of status. Legal consciousness research reveals how residents actively interpret their encounters with institutions. Together, these perspectives allow us to see police-calling not as a paradox of cynicism-despite-reliance, but as an expression of demands for recognition that existing institutions consistently fail to provide.

**When to use**: Synthesis Integrators (the payoff paragraph); Theory-Extenders showing why framework fits.

---

### STATE_QUESTIONS

**Purpose**: Articulate the research questions, hypotheses, or analytical focus of the study.

**Typical markers**:
- "This study examines..."
- "I ask: [question]?"
- "Three questions guide this analysis..."
- "We investigate whether..."

**Example paragraph**:
> This study examines how mothers in doubled-up households negotiate identity and dignity in shared living arrangements. Three questions guide the analysis: (1) How do guest mothers understand their position within host households? (2) What strategies do they use to maintain maternal identity when authority is constrained? (3) How do these negotiations vary by the character of the host-guest relationship? I address these questions through interviews with 47 mothers who doubled up with family or friends.

**When to use**: After the gap; usually the penultimate or final paragraph.

---

### PREVIEW

**Purpose**: Summarize the argument or outline what the findings will show. Provides a roadmap.

**Typical markers**:
- "I find that..." "We show that..."
- "The findings reveal..."
- "In what follows, I first... then... finally..."
- Brief statement of main claims (without evidence)

**Example paragraph**:
> In what follows, I show that guest mothers deploy three strategies to maintain maternal identity: boundary work (carving out private space), deference management (navigating host authority), and temporal framing (emphasizing the temporary nature of arrangements). I argue that these strategies reveal how structural housing precarity intersects with gendered expectations of motherhood to produce distinctive identity work. I conclude by discussing implications for understanding family instability and housing policy.

**When to use**: Final paragraph of the section; optional but common for complex arguments.

## Diagnostic Questions

For each paragraph, ask:
1. What function is this paragraph serving?
2. Is the function clear from the first sentence?
3. Does the function fit its position in the sequence?
4. Is the function appropriate for my cluster?

If you can't identify the function, the paragraph likely needs revision.
