# Cluster 3: Concept-Building Architect

**Prevalence**: 15.0% of articles (most ambitious style)

## When to Use This Cluster

Use the Concept-Builder approach when:
- You're introducing **new terminology, typology, or conceptual framework**
- You've identified limitations in existing concepts that require a new tool
- Your contribution is primarily **theoretical innovation**, not just empirical description
- You're willing to invest significant space in theoretical apparatus

**Best for**: Introducing "carceral creep," developing "epistemological individualism," building a new framework synthesizing multiple traditions.

## Distinguishing Features

| Feature | Concept-Builder Pattern |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Positioning Move** | Theory-building |
| **Arc** | Building-Blocks |
| **Subsections** | Moderate to heavy (3-5+) |
| **Literature Balance** | Theory-heavy (92%) |
| **Visual Elements** | Tables or figures presenting the new framework |
| **Turn Placement** | Middle |
| **Hedging Level** | Low; confident about conceptual contributions |

## Characteristic Paragraph Sequence

The Concept-Builder follows a critique-then-build sequence:

1. **PROVIDE_CONTEXT** - Present the puzzle or problem
2. **DESCRIBE_THEORY** - Review tradition 1 / existing approach
3. **CRITIQUE** - Identify limitations of existing approach
4. **DESCRIBE_THEORY** - Review tradition 2 / alternative approach
5. **SYNTHESIZE** - Draw together limitations → need for new concept
6. **DESCRIBE_THEORY** - Introduce and explicate the new concept

The structure builds toward your conceptual contribution as the payoff.

## Signature Sentence Patterns

### Framing the Puzzle
> "How do [actors] navigate [challenge]? Existing approaches offer limited purchase..."
> "Despite extensive research on [topic], scholars lack conceptual tools for [specific aspect]."

### Critiquing Existing Approaches
> "While this work is valuable, it is limited in [specific ways]..."
> "This approach, however, cannot account for [pattern]..."
> "Existing literature is limited on two fronts. First, [X]. Second, [Y]."

### Introducing the New Concept
> "I use the term *[concept]* to suggest..."
> "We define [concept] as..."
> "*[Concept]* refers to..."
> "By [concept], I mean..."

### Explicating the Concept
> "This concept captures [mechanism] through a process of..."
> "[Concept] operates through [X], [Y], and [Z]."
> "The concept involves [number] dimensions: [list]."

## Citation Patterns

Concept-Builders feature **quote-then-cite** patterns for detailed engagement:
> "As [Scholar] notes, '[direct quote]' (Year:page)."
> "[Scholar] defines [concept] as '...' (Year:page)."

**Author-subject** for sources being critiqued or synthesized:
> "[Scholar] argues that... However, this overlooks..."

**Definitional markers** for your new concept (no hedging):
> "I define [X] as..." (not "might be defined as")

**Citation density**: Highest of all clusters (5+ per paragraph in exposition).

## Hedging Calibration

| Claim Type | Hedging Level |
|------------|---------------|
| Critiquing existing approaches | Moderate ("is limited," "cannot fully account for") |
| Defining your concept | **No hedging** ("refers to," "is," "means") |
| Describing how concept operates | Low hedging ("captures," "involves") |
| Claims about mechanism in empirical context | Moderate hedge |

Concept-Builders should be **confident about their conceptual contribution**. You're building a tool; don't undercut it.

## Calibration Benchmarks (Cluster-Specific)

Based on Concept-Builder articles in the sample:

| Metric | Typical Range |
|--------|---------------|
| **Word count** | 1,600-2,500+ (longest of all clusters) |
| **Paragraphs** | 12-20+ |
| **Subsections** | 3-5+ |
| **Citations** | 40-70+ |
| **Literature balance** | 92% theory-heavy, 8% balanced, 0% substantive-heavy |

Concept-Builders are **distinctly longer** than other clusters. The theoretical apparatus requires space.

## Visual Elements

Concept-Builders are the cluster most likely to include tables or figures:
- **Typology tables**: Present the 3-5 dimensions of your concept
- **Process diagrams**: Show the stages of your framework
- **Comparison tables**: Contrast your concept with existing approaches

If you're building a typology or multi-stage process, consider visualization.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Concept without work | The concept must do analytical work in findings, not just appear in theory |
| Insufficient critique | Show clearly why existing concepts are inadequate |
| Over-hedging definitions | Definitions are assertions, not hypotheses |
| No table when one would help | Multi-dimensional concepts benefit from visualization |
| Too similar to existing concepts | Differentiate your contribution clearly |
| Inadequate explication | New concepts need more space than familiar ones |

## Exemplar Articles

**10.1093_socpro_spz013** - Carceral Creep

## Why This Cluster Works (When It Works)

Concept-Building is the **most ambitious** approach:
1. You're contributing a lasting tool to the discipline
2. Success means other scholars adopt your terminology
3. The payoff is high: your name attached to a concept

The **risk** is also highest:
- If the concept doesn't do clear analytical work, it looks like jargon
- If the concept is too similar to existing ones, reviewers will object
- If the explication is rushed, readers won't understand how to use it

**Only use this cluster if your concept genuinely does work that existing concepts cannot.** If you're not sure, consider whether Synthesis Integrator (integrating existing concepts) might fit better.
