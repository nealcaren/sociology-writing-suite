# Cluster 2: Theory-Extension Framework Applier

**Prevalence**: 22.5% of articles

## When to Use This Cluster

Use the Theory-Extender approach when:
- You're applying an **established theoretical framework** (often with a named originator) to a new empirical domain
- The framework itself is not being modified—you're demonstrating its utility in a new context
- You want to signal **theoretical literacy** while contributing empirical extension
- The framework is well-established enough that extension is meaningful

**Best for**: Applying Bourdieu to a new field, extending Acker's gendered organizations to a new setting, using legal consciousness in a novel context.

## Distinguishing Features

| Feature | Theory-Extender Pattern |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Positioning Move** | Theory-extension |
| **Arc** | Funnel or Building-Blocks |
| **Subsections** | Light to moderate (1-4) |
| **Literature Balance** | Theory-heavy (78%) |
| **Visual Elements** | Occasional tables |
| **Turn Placement** | Middle, sometimes early |
| **Hedging Level** | Low-moderate; confident about established theory |

## Characteristic Paragraph Sequence

The standard Theory-Extender follows this sequence:

1. **PROVIDE_CONTEXT** - Establish the empirical phenomenon
2. **DESCRIBE_THEORY** - Introduce framework X (the named theorist/framework)
3. **SYNTHESIZE** - Review prior applications of framework X
4. **IDENTIFY_GAP** - Show that framework X has not been applied to domain Y
5. **BRIDGE** - Explain how X illuminates Y

The key move is showing that an **existing tool** can do **new work**.

## Signature Sentence Patterns

### Opening with the Framework
> "The concept of '[framework]' draws on..."
> "According to [Scholar] (Year), [framework] posits that..."
> "[Scholar's] (Year) concept of [X] provides a lens for understanding..."
> "Central to this analysis is [framework]..."

### Documenting Prior Applications
> "Scholars have applied [framework] to [domain 1], [domain 2], and [domain 3] (citations)."
> "This framework has proven useful for understanding [pattern]..."
> "Building on this work, scholars have extended [framework] to..."

### Marking the Extension Gap
> "[Framework] has not been applied to [your domain]..."
> "Yet scholars have not examined how [framework] operates in [context]..."
> "We extend this framework to [new empirical domain]..."

### The Bridge Move
> "We argue that [framework] illuminates [phenomenon] by..."
> "[Framework] offers analytical purchase on [empirical puzzle] because..."

## Citation Patterns

Theory-Extenders feature **prominent author-subject constructions** for the canonical theorist:
> "Bourdieu (1984) argues that capital operates through..."
> "According to Puwar (2004), numerical representation matters..."

**Parenthetical strings** for prior applications:
> "Scholars have applied this framework to education (Author 2020), healthcare (Author 2019), and housing (Author 2018)."

**Citation density**: Higher end of range (4-5+ per paragraph in theory exposition).

## Hedging Calibration

| Claim Type | Hedging Level |
|------------|---------------|
| Describing established theory | **Low hedging** ("posits," "demonstrates," "establishes") |
| Reviewing prior applications | Moderate ("studies show," "research finds") |
| Your extension claim | Moderate ("we argue," "we extend") |
| Predictions about mechanisms in your context | Hedge ("may operate," "suggests") |

Theory-Extenders should be **confident about the framework itself**—it's established. The extension is where humility enters.

## Calibration Benchmarks (Cluster-Specific)

Based on Theory-Extender articles in the sample:

| Metric | Typical Range |
|--------|---------------|
| **Word count** | 1,300-1,800 (moderate length) |
| **Paragraphs** | 8-12 |
| **Subsections** | 1-4 |
| **Citations** | 30-45 |
| **Literature balance** | 78% theory-heavy, 22% balanced, 0% substantive-heavy |

Theory-Extenders are **distinctly theory-heavy**. If your literature balance feels "balanced," you may be in Gap-Filler territory.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Modifying the framework | If you're modifying, you're a Concept-Builder, not an Extender |
| Weak framework exposition | Give the framework a full paragraph; readers need to understand it |
| Not showing prior applications | Extensions only matter if the tool has proven useful elsewhere |
| Unclear bridge | Explain *why* this framework fits your domain |
| Framework mentioned but not used | If the framework doesn't organize your analysis, don't claim extension |

## Exemplar Articles

**10.1093_socpro_spz045** - Complex Visibility in Elite Professions
> Extends Puwar's "bodies out of place" framework to understand organizational outsiders navigating elite contexts. Detailed exposition of tokenism theory, then shows how race/gender status characteristics add explanatory power.

**10.1093_socpro_spab024** - Gendered Organizations and Birth Assault
> Applies Acker's gendered organizations framework (culture, structure, agency) to hospital birth experiences. Clear framework application without modification.

**10.1093_socpro_spab036** - Electronic Home Monitoring
> Extends surveillance studies to electronic monitoring context. Framework-first approach.

## Why This Cluster Works

Theory-Extension signals **theoretical sophistication** while keeping risk manageable:
1. You're not inventing new concepts (lower bar)
2. You demonstrate mastery of an established tradition
3. Your contribution is clearly scoped: "X works in Y too"
4. Cumulative science: showing frameworks travel builds knowledge

The danger is that **pure extension** can feel incremental. The bridge paragraph must show why this extension matters—why it reveals something new about both the theory and the domain.
