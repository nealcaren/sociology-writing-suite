# Phase 1: Drafting

You are executing Phase 1 of case-justification. Your goal is to write a complete case justification section following the selected cluster template and word allocation.

## Why This Phase Matters

Case justification sections must accomplish multiple goals: establish the research site, justify case selection, provide necessary context, and connect to the theoretical framework - all within specific word constraints. This phase transforms the cluster template into prose that matches the conventions of *Social Problems* and *Social Forces*.

## Inputs

Before starting, gather:
1. Assessment memo from Phase 0 (cluster selection, components to include)
2. User's case details (site, features, context, theoretical connection)
3. Cluster profile from `clusters/[cluster].md`
4. Opening moves from `techniques/opening-moves.md`
5. Justification strategies from `techniques/justification-strategies.md`
6. Transitions from `techniques/transitions.md`

### 2. Draft the Opening

Choose an opening pattern based on cluster and corpus norms:

**Phenomenon-Site-Link** (50% of corpus - works for all clusters):
> "With the formalization of a labor-export policy in the mid-1970s, the Indonesian government entered the labor brokerage industry."

**Geographic-Introduction** (19% - Standard, Comparative):
> "Kansas is a re-emerging destination for Latina/o immigrants."
> "The UAE is a small Islamic federation of nearly ten million residents in the Arab Gulf."

**Historical-Periodization** (6% - Deep Historical, Policy-Driven):
> "A latecomer in the contemporary women's movement, the U.S. anti-domestic violence movement or the 'battered women's movement' began in 1973..."

**Institutional-Description** (16% - Standard, Comparative):
> "This network of colleges includes over 215,000 students, 21,000 faculty, and over two million living alumni."

**Research-Setting** (9% - Minimal):
> "The data we present here were collected as part of a study of police traffic stops and their effects on police-community relations."

See `techniques/opening-moves.md` for more patterns.

### 3. Incorporate Justification Strategy

Every case justification section must explain why this case. Use one of five strategies:

**Intrinsic-Interest** (38% - all clusters, especially Policy-Driven):
> "Kansas has a complex sociopolitical environment towards immigration."
> "The province of Ontario is especially known (or infamous) for its social assistance reform."

**Theoretical-Fit** (22% - Standard, Deep Historical):
> "Emirati women present a valuable case for understanding how households manage earmarking under conditions where..."

**Empirical-Extremity** (16% - Deep Historical):
> "Nashville was one of the most significant movement centers in the overall southern civil rights struggle, and we have unusually rich data on its movement participants."

**Variation-Leverage** (16% - Comparative only):
> "By controlling for stroll type, we believe the comparison will be richer and will minimize the likelihood that other confounding variables could serve as an alternative explanation."

**Access-Driven** (9% - Minimal only):
> "Given this interest, we were fortunate to gain access to students in a sociology course."

See `techniques/justification-strategies.md` for more patterns.

### 4. Draft Each Component

Work through components based on cluster requirements. Consult the cluster profile for component prevalence.

#### A. Geographic Context

**What to include**:
- Location (state, region, country)
- Relevant geographic features
- Urban/rural characteristics
- Regional positioning

**Example (Standard)**:
> "Kansas is a re-emerging destination for Latina/o immigrants. The railroad industry brought Mexican immigrants to the state at the turn of the 20th century. The movement of the meatpacking industry to rural areas and growth of service sector jobs in the state has attracted Latina/o immigrants to the state."

#### B. Historical Background

**What to include**:
- Key historical developments
- How current conditions emerged
- Temporal markers (decades, years, periods)

**Minimal treatment (Standard)**:
> "The railroad industry brought Mexican immigrants to the state at the turn of the 20th century."

**Extended treatment (Deep Historical)**:
Trace multiple episodes chronologically with named events, dates, and developments.

#### C. Policy/Legal Context

**What to include**:
- Relevant legislation (name and date)
- Policy mechanisms
- Political environment

**Example**:
> "In 2004 undocumented college students gained in-state tuition. However, in the same period the state denied undocumented immigrants access to driver's licenses."

**Dense Policy (Policy-Driven)**:
> "In 1997, then Premier Mike Harris implemented the Ontario Works Act, which slashed social assistance benefit rates by 21.6 percent and immediately froze them."

#### D. Demographic Profile

**What to include**:
- Population statistics with citations
- Racial/ethnic composition
- Socioeconomic characteristics

**Example**:
> "In 2000, seven percent of the state's population was Latina/o and by 2017 this rose to over 11 percent, of whom 34 percent were foreign born."

**Comparative treatment**:
Use a table to compare demographics across sites.

#### E. Institutional Description

**What to include**:
- Organizations studied
- Institutional features
- Structural characteristics

**Example**:
> "In New York State, the site of this study, the child support agency is charged with opening a child support case, establishing paternity, and locating noncustodial parents."

### 5. Draft the Transition

Choose a transition pattern based on cluster:

**Implicit** (66% - most clusters):
Simply end the section; the structural break to Methods carries readers forward.
> [End of case section; Methods begins]

**Integrated** (22% - Comparative):
Fold methods content into site descriptions:
> "Interviews lasted 45 minutes on average. All interviews occurred in the SROs' assigned schools."

**Data-Preview** (6% - Minimal):
> "While the focus of this paper is on the analysis of the interview data..."

**Bridge-Statement** (6% - Policy-Driven):
> "This paper addresses Portland's contradictions by asking: how are these contradictory realities reconciled?"

See `techniques/transitions.md` for more patterns.

### 6. Add Tables (Comparative Only)

If writing a Comparative section, include a table comparing sites:

| Characteristic | Site A | Site B |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| Population | X | Y |
| Demographics | ... | ... |
| Key Feature | ... | ... |

71% of Comparative sections include tables. This is a signature element.

### 7. Calibrate Word Count

After drafting, check word count against cluster targets:

| Cluster | Target | Acceptable Range |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| Minimal | 400 | 300-500 |
| Standard | 850 | 700-1,000 |
| Deep Historical | 2,000 | 1,500-2,500 |
| Comparative | 1,250 | 1,000-1,500 |
| Policy-Driven | 775 | 650-900 |

**If over target**:
- Compress geographic description
- Reduce historical detail (unless Deep Historical)
- Cut redundant policy context
- Move demographics to Methods table

**If under target**:
- Add geographic context
- Expand historical background
- Include demographic statistics
- Add policy/institutional detail

### 8. Verify Position

**CRITICAL**: Confirm the section is positioned correctly:
- **Policy-Driven**: BEFORE theory section
- **All others**: AFTER theory section

---

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Dive Into Substance
Don't open with metadiscourse ("In this section, I describe..."). Start with concrete case information.

### 2. Match Cluster to Content
Follow the word allocation. Don't write 1,500 words for a Standard section or 500 words for Deep Historical.

### 3. Parallel Structure for Comparative
If comparing sites, Site B should cover the same dimensions as Site A. Readers should be able to compare.

### 4. Chronological Organization for Historical
Deep Historical sections tell a story. Name episodes, use dates, trace development.

### 5. Dense Policy for Policy-Driven
Policy-Driven sections have the highest citation density (1.8 per 100 words). Name legislation, detail mechanisms.

### 6. Implicit Transitions Are Normal
66% of corpus sections end without explicit transition. The structural break is sufficient.
