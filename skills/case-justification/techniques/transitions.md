# Transitions: Case Justification Sections

How case justification sections end and transition to the next section (typically Methods). This guide presents the four transition patterns identified in the 32-article corpus.

---

## Overview

| Transition Type | Prevalence | Description |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| Implicit | 66% | Section ends; structure carries readers forward |
| Integrated | 22% | Methods content folded into case section |
| Data-Preview | 6% | Brief mention of what data will show |
| Bridge-Statement | 6% | Explicit question or statement connecting to theory |

---

## Type E3: Implicit Transition (66%)

The most common approach: the section simply ends, and the structural break to the next section (usually Methods) carries readers forward without explicit transition language.

### Pattern
Section concludes with final substantive statement. No transition phrase. Next section begins.

### Examples

**Standard Context**:
> "This anti-immigrant context emerges from a long history of immigration policies that criminalize undocumented migration and racialize illegality, linking stereotypes of Mexican origin to perceptions of illegality."
>
> [Section ends. Methods section begins.]

**Deep Historical**:
> "The vignettes presented in this section provided a broad overview of four major episodes of collective contestation involving the Cairo-based political opposition during the decade preceding the 2011 uprising, showing how relational networks within and across different movement organizations in this sector emerged and evolved over time."
>
> [Section ends. Analysis or Methods begins.]

**Policy-Driven**:
> "New laws also made it harder for deportees to fight their cases, enabling expedited removal without due process or judicial review."
>
> [Section ends. Theory section follows.]

### When to Use
- Default for all clusters
- When structure is clear and readers don't need explicit guidance
- When the section ends on a strong substantive note

### Cluster Distribution
- Minimal: 60%
- Standard: 73%
- Deep Historical: 80%
- Comparative: 43%
- Policy-Driven: 75%

## Type E4: Integrated Transition (22%)

Methods content is woven into the case section itself, so there's no need for a sharp transition - the section already contains methodological information.

### Pattern
Case section includes interview details, sample description, or data collection information. Methods section may be abbreviated or absent.

### Examples

**Comparative** (signature transition - 43%):
> "Interviews lasted 45 minutes on average. All interviews occurred in the SROs' assigned schools throughout the regular school day and covered a variety of topics related to the implementation of SROs in the district."

**Standard Context**:
> "Our sample included 47 participants who completed semi-structured interviews lasting 60-90 minutes."

### What Gets Integrated

- Interview duration and format
- Sample size and composition
- Data collection location
- Brief protocol description

### When to Use
- When describing multiple sites (Comparative) - sample details per site
- When methods are straightforward and brief
- When tight word limits require compression

### Cluster Distribution
- Minimal: 20%
- Standard: 18%
- Deep Historical: 20%
- **Comparative: 43%** (signature)
- Policy-Driven: 0%

**NOTE**: Integrated transitions are the signature pattern for Comparative sections because describing each site naturally includes information about sampling at each site.

## Type E1: Data-Preview Transition (6%)

Brief mention of what the data or analysis will show, setting up the transition to findings or methods.

### Pattern
> "While the focus of this paper is on [X], [brief mention of what data will show]..."

### Examples

**Minimal Context**:
> "While the focus of this paper is on the analysis of the interview data, some findings from the survey of staff will be included."

**Standard Context**:
> "Through statistical analyses of these data, we did not find consistent patterns of racial disparities in who gets stopped citywide... However, we did find significant disparities in several post-stop outcomes."

### When to Use
- In mixed-methods studies when transitioning from quantitative to qualitative
- When briefly foreshadowing findings
- Primarily in Minimal Context

### Cluster Distribution
- Minimal: 20%
- Standard: 9%
- Deep Historical: 0%
- Comparative: 0%
- Policy-Driven: 0%

---

## Type E2: Bridge-Statement Transition (6%)

An explicit statement, often a question, that connects the case context to what theory will address.

### Pattern
> "This paper addresses [contradiction/puzzle] by asking: [research question]?"

### Examples

**Policy-Driven**:
> "This paper addresses Portland's contradictions by asking: how are these contradictory realities reconciled in the lives of Portlanders of color?"

**Standard Context**:
> "How do women navigate these competing expectations? The analysis below examines..."

### When to Use
- When ending with a question that theory will address
- In Policy-Driven sections (where case precedes theory)
- When emphasizing the puzzle your research addresses

### Cluster Distribution
- Minimal: 0%
- Standard: 0%
- Deep Historical: 0%
- **Comparative: 14%**
- **Policy-Driven: 25%**

**NOTE**: Bridge-Statements are most common in Policy-Driven sections because these sections set up the puzzle that the theory section will address.

## Transition Patterns by Cluster

| Cluster | Implicit | Integrated | Data-Preview | Bridge-Statement |
|---------|----------|------------|--------------|------------------|
| Minimal | 60% | 20% | 20% | 0% |
| Standard | 73% | 18% | 9% | 0% |
| Deep Historical | 80% | 20% | 0% | 0% |
| Comparative | 43% | 43% | 0% | 14% |
| Policy-Driven | 75% | 0% | 0% | 25% |

### Key Patterns

1. **Implicit dominates** - 66% overall, majority in every cluster
2. **Integrated is Comparative's signature** - 43% (methods per site)
3. **Bridge-Statement appears in Policy-Driven** - 25% (setting up theory)
4. **Data-Preview is Minimal only** - mixed-methods studies

## Choosing a Transition Type

### Decision Framework

1. **Is this a Comparative section with methods per site?**
   → Integrated (describe methods within site descriptions)

2. **Is this Policy-Driven, setting up a theoretical puzzle?**
   → Bridge-Statement or Implicit

3. **Is this mixed-methods with quantitative findings previewed?**
   → Data-Preview

4. **Is the structure clear without explicit transition?**
   → Implicit (default)

### Default Recommendation

When unsure, use **Implicit**. At 66% prevalence, it's the norm. Explicit transitions can sound labored or unnecessary when structure is clear.

---

## Common Errors

### Over-Transitioning

**Avoid**:
> "Having described the research context, I now turn to the methods section, where I describe how I collected and analyzed the data."

This is unnecessary metadiscourse. The structural break is sufficient.

### Under-Transitioning When Bridge Needed

**Policy-Driven sections that set up puzzles** benefit from Bridge-Statements:

**Weak ending** (for Policy-Driven):
> "The Ontario Works Act slashed benefits by 21.6 percent."

**Stronger ending** (with Bridge):
> "This context raises the question: how do recipients navigate a system explicitly designed to degrade them?"

## Templates by Transition Type

### Implicit Template
> [Final substantive statement about the case. Period.]
>
> ## Methods
> [New section begins]

### Integrated Template
> [Site/case description]. Interviews with [N] respondents were conducted between [dates], lasting [duration]. Participants were recruited through [channels].
>
> [Continue with analysis or brief additional methods]

### Data-Preview Template
> While the focus of this paper is on [primary data type], [secondary data type] will also be discussed. [Brief preview of what data reveal].
>
> ## Methods
> [New section begins]

### Bridge-Statement Template
> [Statement of puzzle or contradiction established by case context]. This paper addresses this [puzzle/contradiction] by asking: [research question]?
>
> ## Theoretical Framework
> [Theory section begins]

---

## Special Considerations

### Position Affects Transition Choice

**BEFORE theory (Policy-Driven only)**:
- Bridge-Statement is appropriate
- Section sets up the puzzle that theory addresses
- Research question can end the section

**AFTER theory (all other clusters)**:
- Implicit is default
- Integrated works for Comparative
- Data-Preview for mixed-methods

### Don't Force Explicit Transitions

If the section ends strongly and structure is clear, let it be. Explicit transitions often add words without adding meaning. The 66% prevalence of Implicit transitions indicates that readers navigate structural breaks effectively.
