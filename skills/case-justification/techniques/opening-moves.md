---

## Overview

| Opening Type | Prevalence | Best For |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| Phenomenon-Site-Link | 50% | All clusters (versatile) |
| Geographic-Introduction | 19% | Standard, Comparative |

| Research-Setting | 9% | Minimal |
| Historical-Periodization | 6% | Deep Historical, Policy-Driven |

## Type A4: Phenomenon-Site-Link (50%)

The most common opening connects the phenomenon under study to the research site. This opening establishes both what you're studying and where, positioning them in relation to each other.

### Pattern
> "[Phenomenon] + [Site Connection]"

### Examples

**Standard Context**:
> "With the formalization of a labor-export policy in the mid-1970s, the Indonesian government entered the labor brokerage industry."

> "Ghostwriting is not a new form of work."

**Deep Historical**:
> "This section lays the groundwork for the subsequent analysis of the role of relational networks within the broader Cairo-based political opposition during the January 25 Uprising."

> "The definitively populist Yellow Vest movement explicitly rejects leadership, unions, parties, nationalism, right-wing or left-wing identifications, xenophobia, and business interests."

**Policy-Driven**:
> "The deportation-carceral system reflects three key changes in immigration enforcement since the 1990s."

> "Despite its overall demographic homogeneity, the Portland metropolitan area is home to some of the most racially diverse communities in the state of Oregon."

### When to Use
- When you want to immediately connect your theoretical concerns to the empirical case
- When the phenomenon is more important than the site's geographic identity
- Works across all clusters

### When to Avoid
- When readers need geographic orientation first
- When the site has distinctive features that should lead

---

## Type A2: Geographic-Introduction (19%)

Opens with the site's geographic identity and characteristics. Common in Standard Context and Comparative clusters where location matters.

### Pattern
> "[Site] is [geographic description]."

### Examples

**Standard Context**:
> "Kansas is a re-emerging destination for Latina/o immigrants."

> "The UAE is a small Islamic federation of nearly ten million residents in the Arab Gulf."

**Comparative**:
> "In 2011, the District of Columbia lost its minority-majority status."

### When to Use
- When the site is not widely known and needs introduction
- When geographic features are analytically important
- When establishing regional context matters

### When to Avoid
- When the site is well-known (unnecessary)
- When phenomenon matters more than location
- In Deep Historical (history should lead) or Policy-Driven (policy should lead)

## Type A3: Institutional-Description (16%)

Opens with a description of the institution, organization, or organizational field being studied.

### Pattern
> "[Institution/Organization] [does/includes/is characterized by X]."

### Examples

**Minimal Context**:
> "This network of colleges includes over 215,000 students, 21,000 faculty, and over two million living alumni."

**Comparative**:
> "The first research site was an affluent suburban county in the South that housed two school districts."

**Policy-Driven**:
> "In New York State, the site of this study, the child support agency is charged with opening a child support case, establishing paternity, and locating noncustodial parents."

### When to Use
- When studying a specific organization or institution
- When institutional features define the case
- In Comparative sections when describing sites as organizations

### When to Avoid
- When the site is geographic rather than organizational
- When policy context should lead

---

## Type A5: Research-Setting (9%)

Opens with a statement about the research project or data collection context. Most common in Minimal Context, especially for mixed-methods designs.

### Pattern
> "[Data/Study description] + [brief context]"

### Examples

**Minimal Context**:
> "The data we present here were collected as part of a study of police traffic stops and their effects on police-community relations."

> "While others have interviewed young people about their gender beliefs and show the consequences of their beliefs for inequality, we sought to determine whether and why their beliefs might feasibly change."

### When to Use
- When the study design or data source needs front-and-center positioning
- In mixed-methods studies where qualitative follows quantitative
- When access or timing defines the research opportunity
- Primarily in Minimal Context

### When to Avoid
- When readers need substantive case context
- In longer sections (Standard, Deep Historical, Comparative)
- When this would read as purely methodological

---

## Type A1: Historical-Periodization (6%)

Opens with a temporal marker or historical statement that positions the case in time. Signature opening for Deep Historical and Policy-Driven.

### Pattern
> "[Time marker/Historical statement about when phenomenon began/emerged]"

### Examples

**Deep Historical**:
> "A latecomer in the contemporary women's movement, the U.S. anti-domestic violence movement or the 'battered women's movement' began in 1973..."

> "The year 2011 was an important moment in the political history of contemporary Russia, the year of Parliamentary elections that sparked mass protests in big Russian cities, the largest in two decades."

**Policy-Driven**:
> "A hallmark of the Canadian social policy climate of the 1990s, social assistance reform was constituted as necessary to address government debts and deficits - the fiscal crisis of the welfare state."

### When to Use
- When historical development is central to the case
- In social movement studies
- When tracing policy evolution
- When the case has a clear origin date

### When to Avoid
- When historical context is background, not foreground
- In Minimal or Standard Context (unless brief historical note)
- When readers need geographic orientation first

## Prohibited Openings (All Clusters)

Never open with:

- **Metadiscourse**: "In this section, I will describe..."
- **Passive hedges**: "It is important to note that..."
- **Self-reference**: "My research setting is..."
- **Purpose statements**: "The purpose of this section is to..."
- **Backwards reference**: "As mentioned above..."

Instead, dive directly into substantive case information.

## Choosing an Opening Move

### Decision Framework

1. **Is the phenomenon more important than the site?**
   → Phenomenon-Site-Link

2. **Do readers need geographic orientation?**
   → Geographic-Introduction

3. **Is this an organizational study?**
   → Institutional-Description

4. **Is this mixed-methods or access-driven?**
   → Research-Setting

5. **Is historical development central?**
   → Historical-Periodization

### Default Recommendation

When unsure, use **Phenomenon-Site-Link**. At 50% prevalence, it's the most common and most versatile opening. It works across all clusters and immediately connects theory to empirics.
