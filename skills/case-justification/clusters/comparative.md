## When to Use This Cluster

### Primary Triggers

Use Comparative when ANY of the following apply:

1. **Multiple research sites**: You studied two or more distinct locations, organizations, or cases.

2. **Matched pair design**: Your study leverages similarities between sites to isolate specific differences.

3. **Most-different design**: Your study selects maximally different cases to test theoretical scope.

4. **Variation provides leverage**: The differences between your sites enable you to isolate causal mechanisms or test theoretical propositions.

5. **Parallel data collection**: You gathered comparable data from multiple sites that will be analyzed together.

### Secondary Indicators

- You have demographic or institutional data to compare across sites
- A table would effectively communicate site differences
- You need to explain what comparing sites enables analytically
- Your findings will involve cross-site comparisons

## Signature Moves

### Opening Patterns

**Macro-Context then Sites** (common):
> "In 2011, the District of Columbia lost its minority-majority status."

**Research Setting Statement**:
> "The first research site was an affluent suburban county in the South that housed two school districts."

**Study Framing**:
> "Situating our research in Atlanta allows us to compare two distinct Latino groups in a new destination with a short history of migration."

### Variation-Leverage Justification (ESSENTIAL)

This is the signature move of Comparative sections. You MUST explain what comparing enables:

**Explicit Comparative Framing**:
> "By controlling for stroll type, we believe the comparison will be richer and will minimize the likelihood that other confounding variables... could serve as an alternative explanation for our findings instead of extent of gentrification."

**What Variation Enables**:
> "Unlike King, Chavez does not require these courses for graduation and does not employ college professors to teach them."

> "Comparatively, SBR runs through Ward 7, a stroll that is also close to public transportation and a major highway, but one that has experienced almost no development or neighborhood-level change during the same period of time."

### Parallel Structure Phrases

**Site A Description**:
> "City Vista, in Ward 5, is located near downtown, close to cultural amenities, public transit, and main highways. Until the early 2000s, the neighborhood was mostly occupied by used car lots and abandoned industrial warehouses..."

**Site B Description (parallel)**:
> "Similarly, the census tracts that comprise the SBR neighborhood are changing much more slowly than the rest of the city, presenting a sharp contrast to City Vista's rapid transformation."

### Table Introduction

> "See Table 1."

> "This move generates a dramatic change in families' residential contexts. Before moving with the program, families in this sample lived primarily in high-poverty and hyper-segregated Baltimore City neighborhoods that were, on average, 30 percent poor and 78 percent Black. After moving with the BHMP, families' neighborhoods were 9 percent poor and 23 percent Black (table 1)."

### Demographic Comparison Language

> "Compared to the other schools in this county, the schools in the small city were more racially and socioeconomically diverse, with roughly 15 percent African American students, 25 percent Hispanic students, and 40 percent of these students receiving free or reduced-price lunch."

### Transition Patterns

**Integrated** (43% - signature for Comparative):
Fold methods content into site descriptions:
> "Interviews lasted 45 minutes on average. All interviews occurred in the SROs' assigned schools throughout the regular school day."

**Implicit** (43%):
Section ends; methods follows.

## Prohibited Moves

Comparative sections should AVOID:

1. **Treating sites as undifferentiated** - Each site needs distinct description
2. **Asymmetric treatment** - Sites should receive comparable coverage
3. **Missing the leverage statement** - You MUST explain what comparison enables
4. **Positioning before theory** - That signals Policy-Driven
5. **Omitting tables when data exists** - Tables are the signature visual element

## Template Structure

### Two-Site Comparative Template

```
## Site Selection / Overview

Paragraph 1: Macro-context for the comparison
- What connects the sites
- Why this comparison makes sense

Paragraph 2: Site selection rationale
- How sites were chosen
- What variation enables

## [Site A Name]

Paragraph 3: Geographic/institutional context for Site A
- Location
- Key characteristics

Paragraph 4: Demographics and/or history of Site A

[If methods integrated: Paragraph on data collection at Site A]

## [Site B Name]

Paragraph 5: Geographic/institutional context for Site B (parallel to Site A)
- Location
- Key characteristics (in parallel)

Paragraph 6: Demographics and/or history of Site B

[If methods integrated: Paragraph on data collection at Site B]

## [Optional: Thematic Subsection]

Paragraph 7: Additional context relevant to both sites

## Table Design Guidelines

### What Tables Should Compare

Based on corpus examples, Comparative tables typically include:

**Demographic characteristics**:
- Racial/ethnic composition
- Poverty rates
- Population change over time

**Institutional characteristics**:
- Program features (e.g., gateway requirements)
- Policy differences
- Organizational structure

**Outcome-relevant variables**:
- Pre/post comparisons
- Site-specific metrics

### Table Format

| Characteristic | Site A | Site B | [Site C] |
|----------------|--------|--------|----------|
| Demographic 1 | Value | Value | Value |
| Demographic 2 | Value | Value | Value |
| Institutional 1 | Value | Value | Value |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Key features**:
- 2 subsections (Suburban-White District, Urban-Diverse District)
- Research-Setting opening
- No table (29% of Comparative lack tables)
- Methods integrated (interview details per site)
- Variation-Leverage justification

**Opening**: "The first research site was an affluent suburban county in the South that housed two school districts."

### Tertiary Exemplar: Baltimore Housing Mobility

**Why exemplar**: Pre/post comparison with tables showing neighborhood and school changes.

**Key features**:
- Single site but pre/post comparison
- 2 tables (neighborhood characteristics, school characteristics)

## Calibration Checklist

Before submitting a Comparative section, verify:

- [ ] Word count is 1,000-1,500 words
- [ ] 5-10 paragraphs present
- [ ] At least 2 subsections (one per major site or theme)
- [ ] Parallel structure for site descriptions
- [ ] Comparison table included (strongly recommended)
- [ ] Variation-leverage statement present (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Site selection rationale clear
- [ ] Positioned after theory section
- [ ] Each site receives comparable coverage

### If your section lacks a table:
Consider adding one. 71% of Comparative sections include tables. Tables are the visual signature of this cluster.

### If your sites are not receiving parallel treatment:
Ensure Site B description covers the same dimensions as Site A. Readers should be able to compare.

### If you have a single site:
You probably need **Standard Context**, not Comparative. Exception: pre/post comparisons within a single program can use Comparative structure.

### If variation-leverage statement is missing:
Add it. The statement "By comparing X and Y, we can examine Z..." is essential to Comparative.
