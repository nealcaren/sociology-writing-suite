## When to Use This Cluster

### Primary Triggers

Use Deep Historical when ANY of the following apply:

1. **Social movement study**: You are tracking protest cycles, contentious episodes, or movement development over time.

2. **Multiple episodes matter**: Your case involves distinct events, periods, or phases that must be traced chronologically.

3. **"How we got here" is analytical**: The historical sequence of events is not merely background but is integral to understanding your findings.

4. **Periodization is necessary**: Your case requires organizing context by time periods (e.g., "the 1990s," "the Kefaya period," "post-2011").

5. **Deep context required**: Readers need extensive background to understand the contemporary phenomenon you study.

### Secondary Indicators

- You have 4+ paragraphs of historical content
- Your case involves named episodes or protest waves
- You use dates and temporal markers frequently
- You cite scholarly work on the site's history
- Interview quotes appear within the case section itself

## Signature Moves

### Opening Patterns

**Historical Periodization** (40%):
> "A latecomer in the contemporary women's movement, the U.S. anti-domestic violence movement or the 'battered women's movement' began in 1973..."

> "The year 2011 was an important moment in the political history of contemporary Russia, the year of Parliamentary elections that sparked mass protests in big Russian cities, the largest in two decades."

**Phenomenon-Site Link with Historical Framing** (60%):
> "This section lays the groundwork for the subsequent analysis of the role of relational networks within the broader Cairo-based political opposition during the January 25 Uprising."

> "The definitively populist Yellow Vest movement explicitly rejects leadership, unions, parties, nationalism, right-wing or left-wing identifications, xenophobia, and business interests."

### Dating the Origins

> "While several accounts seeking to explain the Egyptian Uprising of 2011 begin with the killing of Khaled Said... it seems more appropriate to date the origins of this episode of collective contestation to the beginning of the new millennium."

### Episode Transition Markers

> "As early as 2006, the industrial town of Mahalla El-Kubra had been the site for collective contestation..."

> "In late 2009, yet another actor appeared on the scene of the Cairo-based political opposition..."

> "Two years later, in early 2008, Mahalla would again become a focal point for protests."

### Embedded Interview Quotes

Deep Historical sections often embed participant voices within the case narrative:
> "The Palestinian Intifada... gathered sort of loosely connected networks of activists of sympathizers, Leftists like myself, Socialists, and Nationalists, Nasserists, Liberals and Islamists." (Interview #1)

### Wrap-Up/Summary Phrases

> "The vignettes presented in this section provided a broad overview of four major episodes of collective contestation involving the Cairo-based political opposition during the decade preceding the 2011 uprising, showing how relational networks... emerged and evolved over time."

## Prohibited Moves

Deep Historical sections should AVOID:

1. **Brief treatment** - Under 1,200 words is too short for this cluster
2. **Single paragraph for history** - Chronology requires multiple paragraphs
3. **Position before theory** - That signals Policy-Driven
4. **Skipping chronological development** - The arc matters
5. **Non-narrative structure** - Deep Historical tells a story

## Calibration Checklist

Before submitting a Deep Historical section, verify:

- [ ] Word count is 1,500-2,500 words (may exceed if warranted)
- [ ] 8-16 paragraphs present
- [ ] At least 2 subsections
- [ ] Chronological organization is clear
- [ ] Named episodes or periods are identified
- [ ] Historical development is traced (not just mentioned)
- [ ] Scholarly citations on the site/case included
- [ ] Positioned after theory section
- [ ] Summary/wrap-up paragraph present

### If your section is under 1,200 words:
You may not need Deep Historical. Consider:
- **Standard Context** if historical background is just context
- Whether you can expand with additional episodes

### If your section has no clear episodes:
Deep Historical requires discrete events, periods, or phases. If your case does not have these, consider:
- **Standard Context** with historical background
- **Policy-Driven** if policy evolution is the focus

### If you have multiple sites being compared:
You may need **Comparative** with historical elements, not pure Deep Historical. Consider hybrid approach.

## Special Considerations

### Interview Quotes in Case Section

Deep Historical is the only cluster where interview quotes commonly appear within the case justification itself (not just in Methods or Findings). Use quotes to:
- Illustrate episodes from participant perspectives
- Show how activists understood key events
- Provide "you are there" texture to historical narrative

### Tables in Deep Historical

About 40% of Deep Historical sections include tables. Use tables for:
- Comparing strategies or approaches across periods
- Summarizing episode characteristics
- Comparing sites within a movement (if applicable)

### Length Flexibility

Deep Historical is the most length-flexible cluster. The corpus maximum (3,210 words) belongs to this cluster. If your case genuinely requires tracing multiple episodes across an extended time period, longer sections are acceptable.
