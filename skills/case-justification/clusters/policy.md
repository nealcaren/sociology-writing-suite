| Cluster Name | Policy-Driven |
| N in corpus | 4 (13%) |

| Paragraphs | 3-6 |
| Subsections | 1 |
| Position | **BEFORE theory** |
| Table | Never |

## When to Use This Cluster

### Primary Triggers

Use Policy-Driven when ALL of the following apply:

1. **Policy IS the phenomenon**: The policy, law, or institutional arrangement is itself what you are studying (not just background context).

2. **Context motivates theory**: Readers must understand the policy/institutional context BEFORE your theoretical framework makes sense.

3. **"What" before "why"**: The empirical reality must be established before you can theorize about it.

4. **Strong applied implications**: Your research has direct policy relevance and the context establishes the stakes.

### Secondary Indicators

- Your case section would logically precede your theory section
- Policy details are dense and central (not brief background)
- You cite specific legislation, acts, or institutional arrangements
- The policy environment IS the puzzle your theory will address

### The Key Distinguishing Feature

**Position**: Policy-Driven is the ONLY cluster positioned BEFORE the theory section. All other clusters follow theory. If your case context should come after theory, use a different cluster.

## Signature Moves

### Opening Patterns

**Historical-Periodization with Policy Focus** (25%):
> "A hallmark of the Canadian social policy climate of the 1990s, social assistance reform was constituted as necessary to address government debts and deficits - the fiscal crisis of the welfare state."

**Phenomenon-Site Link with Policy Content** (75%):
> "The deportation-carceral system reflects three key changes in immigration enforcement since the 1990s."

> "Despite its overall demographic homogeneity, the Portland metropolitan area is home to some of the most racially diverse communities in the state of Oregon."

**Institutional Description**:
> "In New York State, the site of this study, the child support agency is charged with opening a child support case, establishing paternity, and locating noncustodial parents."

### Policy Establishment Phrases

**Naming Key Legislation**:
> "In 1996, the U.S. Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) vastly increased spending on immigration enforcement and expanded the list of deportable 'crimes' to include misdemeanors such as non-violent theft, identity fraud, domestic violence, drug crimes, gambling, and tax evasion."

> "In 1997, then Premier Mike Harris implemented the Ontario Works Act, which slashed social assistance benefit rates by 21.6 percent and immediately froze them."

**Establishing Notoriety/Significance**:
> "The province of Ontario is especially known (or infamous) for its social assistance reform that demonstrated punitive allegiance to neo-liberal prescriptions and the resolute pursuit of market citizenship."

**Policy Mechanisms**:
> "It also has a number of administrative and judicial tools available to collect and enforce child support orders, including wage withholding, license revocation, tax refund intercepts, asset seizure, and incarceration."

### Historical Context for Policy

> "However, the overtly racist history of Portland and the state of Oregon contrasts with this reputation as an oasis of liberal politics. In 1857, Oregon adopted a state constitution banning Black people from entering, residing, or holding property in the state."

> "New laws also made it harder for deportees to fight their cases, enabling expedited removal without due process or judicial review."

### Bridge to Theory Phrases

Policy-Driven sections often end with a question or statement that theory will address:

> "This paper addresses Portland's contradictions by asking: how are these contradictory realities reconciled in the lives of Portlanders of color?"

## Prohibited Moves

Policy-Driven sections should NEVER:

1. **Position after theory** - This is the defining feature; BEFORE theory is mandatory
2. **Include comparison tables** - Tables signal Comparative treatment
3. **Use minimal treatment** - Policy context requires elaboration (650+ words)
4. **Treat policy as background** - Policy is foreground in this cluster
5. **Skip legislation/institutional details** - Dense policy content is expected

## Exemplar Articles

### Primary Exemplar: Ontario Social Assistance Reform

**Why exemplar**: Exemplifies the Policy-Driven cluster perfectly. Opens with historical-periodization ("A hallmark of the Canadian social policy climate of the 1990s"), establishes policy context (neoliberal welfare reform, Common Sense Revolution, Ontario Works Act), and positions BEFORE THEORY because understanding the policy is prerequisite to theorizing about it.

**Key features**:
- Position: BEFORE THEORY
- ~652 words
- Single subsection
- Historical-Periodization opening
- Intrinsic-Interest justification (Ontario as "notorious")
- Heavy policy/legal content

**Opening**: "A hallmark of the Canadian social policy climate of the 1990s, social assistance reform was constituted as necessary to address government debts and deficits - the fiscal crisis of the welfare state."

**Structure**:
1. Canadian social policy context (1990s)
2. Ontario's specific reforms
3. Ontario Works Act details

## Calibration Checklist

Before submitting a Policy-Driven section, verify:

- [ ] **Positioned BEFORE theory section** (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Word count is 650-900 words
- [ ] 3-6 paragraphs present
- [ ] Single subsection heading
- [ ] Specific legislation/programs named
- [ ] Policy mechanisms detailed
- [ ] Intrinsic-Interest justification present
- [ ] No comparison tables
- [ ] Dense policy content (not brief background)

### If your section is positioned AFTER theory:
You do not have a Policy-Driven section. Reconsider:
- **Standard Context** if policy is just background
- Whether repositioning is appropriate

### If your section lacks dense policy content:
Policy-Driven requires detailed policy/legal/institutional description. If you only have 1-2 sentences of policy context, use:
- **Standard Context** with policy component
- **Minimal Context** if case requires little context

### If you are comparing policy implementations across sites:
You may need **Comparative** with policy emphasis, not Policy-Driven.

---

## Special Considerations

### The BEFORE THEORY Position

This is the most important distinguishing feature of Policy-Driven. The logic is:

1. Readers cannot understand your theoretical framework without first understanding the policy context
2. The policy context MOTIVATES the theoretical framework
3. The "what" (policy) must precede the "why" (theory)

If this logic does not apply to your case, do not use Policy-Driven.

### Justification Strategy

Policy-Driven sections use Intrinsic-Interest justification (100% in corpus). The case matters because the policy itself matters - not because it fits a theoretical framework (that comes later) or provides variation (Comparative territory).

### Citation Density

Policy-Driven has the highest citation density (1.8 per 100 words). Expect to cite:
- Specific legislation and legal sources
- Prior studies of this policy/institution
- Statistics on policy implementation
- News sources or government reports
