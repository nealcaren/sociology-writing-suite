# Phase 2: Persona Construction

## Why This Phase Matters

A simulated reviewer is only as good as the persona behind it. This phase reads the retrieved sources deeply to understand each perspective's core commitments, methodological preferences, and evaluative criteria. We're not creating caricatures—we're building informed representations of how these scholars actually think about research.

---

## Your Tasks

### 1. Deep Reading Protocol

For each reviewer's sources, read systematically to extract:

**Theoretical commitments**:
- What concepts are central to their framework?
- What causal mechanisms do they emphasize?
- What do they see as the key explanatory factors?
- What theoretical traditions do they build on or reject?

**Methodological preferences**:
- What methods do they use and advocate?
- What do they see as rigorous evidence?
- How do they handle validity concerns?
- What methodological moves do they criticize in others?

**Evaluative criteria**:
- What makes research "good" in their view?
- What do they praise in others' work?
- What do they critique in others' work?
- What would they want to see in a study like the manuscript?

**Key terminology**:
- What concepts do they use distinctively?
- What language marks work as part of their tradition?
- What terms would they expect to see (or not see)?

### 2. Build Persona Profile

For each reviewer, construct a detailed profile.

**IMPORTANT**: Name personas for theoretical perspectives, not individual scholars. Even when sources come primarily from one author, name the persona for the *perspective* that work represents (e.g., "Emotions in Movements Perspective" not "Deborah Gould"; "Activist Career Approach" not "Fillieule").

```markdown
# Reviewer Persona: [Theoretical Perspective Name]

## Identity
- **Perspective**: [Name of theoretical/methodological framework]
- **Key scholars**: [Authors whose work informs this—for context, not naming the reviewer]
- **Associated with**: [Institutions, journals, intellectual traditions]

- [Type of critique they make]: [Example from sources]

---

## Evaluative Criteria

### What They Value in Scholarship
1. [Quality 1]: [Evidence from sources]
2. [Quality 2]: [Evidence from sources]
3. [Quality 3]: [Evidence from sources]

### What They Critique
1. [Problem 1]: [How they express this critique]
2. [Problem 2]: [How they express this critique]

### Signature Questions They Ask
- "[Question 1]"
- "[Question 2]"
- "[Question 3]"

---

## Review Focus

**Assigned sections**: [Theory + Findings] OR [Methods + Findings]

**Why this focus**: [Rationale based on their expertise]

**Key concerns for this manuscript**:
Based on reading the manuscript and understanding this perspective:
- [Likely concern 1]
- [Likely concern 2]
- [Likely concern 3]

---

## Relationship to Manuscript

### How Manuscript Engages This Perspective
- **Cited**: [Yes/No — which works, how many times]
- **Engagement type**: [Builds on / Extends / Challenges / Compares / Ignores]
- **Accuracy of representation**: [Initial assessment]

### Predicted Orientation
- **Overall stance**: [Likely supportive / Mixed / Likely critical]
- **Reasoning**: [Why we expect this orientation]

---

## Voice and Tone

Based on reading their work:
- **Writing style**: [Formal/accessible, theoretical/empirical, etc.]
- **Critique style**: [Direct/diplomatic, conceptual/methodological, etc.]
- **Typical phrases**:
  - "[Phrase they commonly use]"
  - "[Another characteristic phrase]"
```

### 3. Validate Persona Against Sources

For each persona, verify claims are grounded in sources:

- Can you cite where each "core commitment" comes from?
- Are "signature questions" actually questions they ask in their work?
- Do "common critiques" reflect critiques they've actually made?

Flag any characterizations that are inferred rather than directly evidenced.

### 4. Identify Persona Limitations

Note what the persona can and cannot assess:

```markdown
## Persona Limitations: [Name]

### Strong Ground
- [Topic/area where sources provide rich basis]
- [Topic/area where sources provide rich basis]

### Limited Ground
- [Topic/area where sources are thin]
- [Topic/area where we're extrapolating]

### Cannot Assess
- [Topic/area outside this perspective's expertise]
```

### 5. Cross-Check Personas

Ensure the 2-3 personas are complementary:

```markdown
## Persona Comparison

| Dimension | Reviewer 1 | Reviewer 2 | Reviewer 3 |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
| Focus | Theory + Findings | Methods + Findings | Theory + Findings |
| Orientation | Supportive | Critical | Mixed |
| Emphasis | Conceptual | Methodological | Empirical |
| Likely concerns | [Brief] | [Brief] | [Brief] |

### Coverage Assessment
- **Theory section**: Covered by Reviewers 1, 3
- **Methods section**: Covered by Reviewer 2
- **Findings section**: Covered by all

### Potential Blind Spots
[Any areas not covered by selected reviewers]
```

## Output Files to Create

Save to project analysis folder:

1. **persona-reviewer1.md** - Complete persona profile for first reviewer
2. **persona-reviewer2.md** - Complete persona profile for second reviewer
3. **persona-reviewer3.md** - Complete persona profile for third reviewer (if applicable)
4. **persona-comparison.md** - Cross-comparison and coverage assessment
5. **persona-summary.md** - Summary for user review

---

## Guiding Principles

### Grounded, Not Stereotyped
Every claim about what a reviewer "thinks" should trace to something they actually wrote.

### Charitable Interpretation
Represent perspectives fairly, even if you (or the manuscript) disagree with them.

### Acknowledge Limitations
Note where personas are well-grounded vs. where we're extrapolating from limited sources.

### Complementary Coverage
The set of reviewers should cover different aspects of the manuscript.

### Authentic Voice
Use language and concerns that actually appear in their work, not generic academic critique.

## When You're Done

Report to the orchestrator:
- Persona profiles complete for all reviewers
- Source grounding verified
- Limitations noted
- Complementary coverage confirmed
- Ready for user approval of personas

Example summary:
> "**Personas constructed**. Reviewer 1 (Cultural Capital in Education): Strong grounding from 4 sources, theory + findings focus, likely supportive of framework but will scrutinize application. Reviewer 2 (Interview Validity Perspective): Adequate grounding from 3 sources, methods + findings focus, will examine sampling and analytic transparency. Reviewer 3 (Critical Education Scholarship): Limited grounding (1 source), theory + findings focus—persona is more extrapolated, flagged for user. Cross-check shows good coverage of theory and methods; findings covered by all. Ready for user review of personas before simulated reviews."
