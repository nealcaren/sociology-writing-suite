# Detailed Pathway

**Prevalence**: 23% of corpus (18/77 articles)

**Contribution logic**: "Given the complexity of our design and/or vulnerability of our population, we document our methods comprehensively for transparency and replicability."

---

## Identifying Detailed Pathway Articles

Your study fits the Detailed pathway if ANY of the following apply:
- Vulnerable or marginalized population
- Multi-site or comparative design
- Complex sampling (stratified, merged sources, longitudinal)
- Incarcerated, detained, or legally precarious participants
- Significant access challenges
- Large sample (100+)
- Longitudinal/repeated interviews
- Topic requires extensive methodological justification

**Key indicators**:
- Word count target: 2,000-3,000 words
- Demographic table required (100% have tables)
- 2-4 subsections recommended
- Positionality encouraged (28% include)

## Detailed Pathway Triggers

### 1. Population Characteristics

| Trigger | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| **Vulnerable population** | Incarcerated, undocumented, survivors of violence |
| **Marginalized groups** | Sex workers, gang members, people experiencing homelessness |
| **Hard-to-reach population** | Diaspora activists, elites, people exiting institutions |
| **Legally precarious** | DACA recipients, people with criminal records |

### 2. Design Complexity

| Trigger | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| **Multi-site comparison** | UK vs. Denmark; Atlanta vs. NYC |
| **Multiple participant types** | Detained parents + spouses + children |
| **Longitudinal/repeated** | 5 interviews over 1 year post-release |
| **Merged data sources** | Interviews + survey + administrative data |
| **Stratified sampling** | By county, move timing, age at event |

### 3. Sample Size

| Trigger | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **Large sample (100+)** | Requires table; prose insufficient |
| **Large N with subgroups** | Breakdown across multiple dimensions needed |

### 4. Access and Recruitment

| Trigger | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| **Institutional gatekeepers** | Sheriff's Department provided lists |
| **Significant refusal rate** | 75 of 215 declined |
| **Multi-channel recruitment** | Organizations + social media + referrals |
| **Follow-up interviews** | 28 of 51 available for re-interview |

## Signature Moves (Do This)

### 1. Research Design Opening
Open with explicit research question and design framing.

> "This study explains how and to what extent diaspora movements support anti-regime rebellions using original, comparative evidence from the Arab Spring abroad."

### 2. Unit of Analysis Specified
Explicitly state what is being compared/analyzed.

> "The unit of analysis is diaspora movement by national group (Libyan, Syrian, and Yemeni) and host country (the US and Great Britain)."

### 3. Case Selection Logic Detailed
Provide explicit criteria for case selection.

> "The six cases provide an ideal set of comparisons for several reasons. First,... Second,... Third,..."

### 4. Table with Population Comparison
Compare sample demographics to broader population.

> "Table 1 presents selected characteristics of our participants and compares them to estimates of the broader population of [group]."

### 5. Response/Refusal Rates
Document participation rates explicitly.

> "215 detainees were asked to participate; 75 refused, resulting in a final sample of 140 individuals."

### 6. Instrument Provenance
Describe where interview guide came from.

> "The [validated instrument name] informed the initial development of the interview instrument."

### 7. Ethical Considerations Paragraph
Include dedicated discussion of protections for vulnerable populations.

> "Because some participants were still being adjudicated, we did not want them to disclose any information that could jeopardize their case or safety. For this reason, we obtained verbal rather than written consent and did not maintain records of any personal information."

### 8. Positionality as Methodological Resource
Discuss how researcher identity shaped data, including positive effects.

> "As the only researcher of color on the team, I drew upon my racial/ethnic background and familial experience with incarceration to build rapport. These shared sensibilities not only facilitated data collection, they influenced my writing."

### 9. Subsection Organization
Use headers to organize complexity.

> "DATA COLLECTION" followed by "ANALYSIS"

### 10. Specific Codes Listed
Name the actual codes used.

> "These codes included *trust, rejection, loneliness, shame, hopelessness, excitement*, among others."

### 11. Prevalence Statistics
Provide frequency information for qualitative findings.

> "Gang enhancements surfaced in nearly 25 percent of interviews."

### 12. Dataset Quantification
Report total data volume.

> "Approximately 300 hours of digital recordings and 2,000 pages of single-spaced transcriptions."

## Prohibited Moves (Don't Do This)

### 1. Skipping Table
All Detailed pathway sections require at least one demographic table.

**Why**: Complexity requires structured presentation.

### 2. Glossing Over Access
If access was challenging, document it; do not minimize.

**Why**: Readers need to understand how institutional relationships shaped sample.

### 3. Omitting Ethical Safeguards
For vulnerable populations, ethical protections MUST be documented.

**Why**: Ethical transparency is non-negotiable with vulnerable groups.

### 4. Unnamed Analysis Approach
Name the approach with citations; do not just say "coded transcripts."

**Why**: Detailed pathway expects methodological specificity.

### 5. Ignoring Positionality
When studying marginalized groups, researcher identity matters; address it.

**Why**: Positionality affects access, disclosure, and interpretation.

### 6. Under-Specifying Complex Designs
Multi-site, comparative, longitudinal designs require explicit explanation of timing, comparability, case selection.

**Why**: Readers cannot assess validity without understanding design logic.

## Table Design Guidance

### Required Table Elements
- Demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity)
- Study-specific characteristics (education, occupation, offense type)
- N and percentages

### Population Comparison (Recommended)

| Characteristic | Sample (N=140) | Population |
|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Male | 92% | 89% |
| Black | 48% | 52% |
| Mean age | 29 | 31 |

## Subsection Options

**Option A**: Two subsections
- "Data Collection"
- "Analysis"

**Option B**: Three subsections
- "Research Design"
- "Data Collection"
- "Analytical Procedures"

## Positionality Guidance

### Structure (200 words)
1. **Identity disclosure** (~40 words): Who are the researchers?
2. **Constraining effects** (~60 words): How might identity have limited data?
3. **Enabling effects** (~60 words): How might identity have helped?
4. **Interpretation** (~40 words): What does this mean for findings?

### Example
> "The interview team was predominantly white, while our respondents were all Black men who had experienced incarceration. It is important to recognize that this positionality may have restricted the stories our interviewees felt able to tell, particularly about experiences of racism in the criminal justice system. Yet as the only researcher of color on the team, I drew upon my racial/ethnic background and familial experience with incarceration to build rapport. These shared sensibilities not only facilitated data collection, they influenced my analysis and writing. I directly and generously quote respondents as a way to ensure that the sociological claims made in this paper reflect the lived experiences of those most affected."

## Ethical Considerations Section

### When Required
- Vulnerable population (incarcerated, undocumented, survivors)
- Non-standard consent procedures
- Information security measures taken
- Topics deliberately not asked

### Structure (~200 words)
1. **IRB approval** (~20 words)
2. **Consent process** (~60 words): Standard or adapted?
3. **Information security** (~60 words): What protections?
4. **Scope limitations** (~60 words): What was NOT asked and why?

### Example
> "The study received institutional review board approval. Because some participants were still being adjudicated, we did not want them to disclose any information that could jeopardize their case or safety. For this reason, we obtained verbal rather than written consent and did not maintain records of any personal information (e.g., jail ID number) that could create a 'paper trail.' Potential participants contacted us through a dedicated cellphone line or an encrypted email account. With similar ethical considerations in mind, we also did not ask for details regarding a participant's current or past charges. Each family also received a resource packet with information about housing, legal, and food assistance programs."
