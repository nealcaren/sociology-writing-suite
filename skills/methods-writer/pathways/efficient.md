# Efficient Pathway

**Prevalence**: 10% of corpus (8/77 articles)

**Contribution logic**: "I conducted interviews with [population]; here's the essentials you need to know."

---

## Identifying Efficient Pathway Articles

Your study fits the Efficient pathway if:
- Design is straightforward (single-site, standard sampling)
- Population is accessible and not vulnerable
- Methods are secondary to theoretical contribution
- Space constraints require compression
- Study design requires minimal justification

**Key indicators**:
- Word count target: 600-900 words
- No demographic table in methods body
- No positionality discussion
- Continuous prose (no subsections)

## Word Allocation

```
EFFICIENT METHODS SECTION (~700 words)

[Opening + Study Overview]     ~150 words
[Sample + Recruitment]         ~200 words
[Protocol]                     ~150 words
[Analysis]                     ~150 words
[Confidentiality close]        ~50 words
```

## Signature Moves (Do This)

### 1. Integrated Opening
Combine study introduction with population definition in a single efficient move.

> "I draw from 41 in-depth interviews with Black middle-class adults."

> "This paper draws on 47 interviews conducted with guest mothers in Chicago between 2019 and 2021."

### 2. Definitional Work Early
If population requires definition, do so immediately without extensive justification.

> "Traditionally, sociologists define the middle-class through some combination of education, income, and occupation. I classify middle-class as meeting two out of three of these criteria."

### 3. Recruitment in Passing
Describe recruitment method without channel-by-channel details.

> "To find middle-class participants, I used purposeful snowball sampling, recruiting from Black alumni associations and professional organizations."

### 4. Prose Demographics
Report sample composition in narrative form rather than table.

> "The sample was majority male (87 percent) and white (55 percent). Respondents ranged in age from 28 to 64."

### 5. Duration as Quality Marker
Use duration report as implicit quality signal without elaboration.

> "Interviews lasted an hour and fifteen minutes on average."

### 6. Named Approach + Software
Compress analysis to approach name, citation, and software mention.

> "Following an abductive approach (Timmermans and Tavory 2012), I coded using Dedoose."

### 7. Confidentiality Close
End with brief confidentiality statement.

> "For the sake of confidentiality, all respondents' names have been changed."

## Prohibited Moves (Don't Do This)

### 1. Demographic Tables
No tables in methods body. If needed, reference appendix.

**Why**: Tables signal complexity that Efficient pathway lacks.

### 2. Extensive Case Justification
Do not spend >100 words justifying why this site/population.

**Why**: Case justification implies complexity requiring Detailed pathway.

### 3. Response/Refusal Rate Discussion
Omit unless it affects sample interpretation.

**Why**: Word count priority; rates imply systematic sampling requiring more detail.

### 4. Positionality Paragraphs
Do not include dedicated positionality discussion.

**Why**: Adds 150+ words without serving Efficient pathway's goals.

### 5. Intercoder Reliability
Omit coding process details beyond named approach.

**Why**: Detailed coding discussion belongs in Standard/Detailed pathways.

### 6. Multiple Subsections
Maintain continuous prose; no section headers within methods.

**Why**: Headers signal structural complexity incompatible with Efficient pathway.

### 7. Ethical Considerations Paragraph
Mention IRB/consent briefly if at all; no dedicated paragraph.

**Why**: Extended ethical discussion signals vulnerable population requiring Detailed pathway.

### 8. Population Comparison
Do not compare sample to broader population.

**Why**: Comparison implies representativeness concerns requiring more documentation.

[Recruitment: "To find middle-class participants, I used purposeful
snowball sampling, recruiting from Black alumni associations of large
universities, Black faculty organizations, and professional networks."]
(~80 words)

[Sample description: "Respondents ranged in age between 28 and 64.
Interviews were conducted with 23 men and 18 women. Most held graduate
degrees and worked in professional occupations."]

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Under-documentation** | Only use for genuinely simple designs |
| **Reviewer pushback** | Be prepared to expand for revisions |
| **Credibility concerns** | Ensure sample N and duration are reported |
| **Missing protections** | Do NOT use for vulnerable populations |

---

## Upgrade Triggers

Consider upgrading to Standard pathway when:
- Reviewer requests more detail
- Sample composition is crucial for claims
- Subfield norms expect more documentation
- Adding a table would strengthen credibility
