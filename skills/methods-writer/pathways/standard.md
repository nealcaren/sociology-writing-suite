# Standard Pathway

**Prevalence**: 61% of corpus (47/77 articles) - **DEFAULT**

**Contribution logic**: "Here's a balanced account of our data, sampling, and analysis that establishes credibility without over-documenting."

---

## Identifying Standard Pathway Articles

Your study fits the Standard pathway if:
- Typical single-site interview study
- Accessible population (not vulnerable)
- Standard sampling (purposive, snowball, convenience)
- 30-80 interviews
- No unusual ethical concerns
- Journal expects moderate methods detail

**Key indicators**:
- Word count target: 1,200-1,500 words
- Demographic table recommended (60% have tables)
- 0-2 subsections optional
- Positionality conditional (15% include)

**Standard is the DEFAULT pathway**. Use when no Efficient or Detailed triggers apply.

## Signature Moves (Do This)

### 1. Conceptual Frame Opening
Open with brief positioning before introducing data.

> "While the recent revival of elite studies has been dominated by economic definitions, here we draw on a wider conception that combines positional and reputational definitions. Specifically, we analyze 71 interviews from two complementary research projects."

### 2. Sample with Table Reference
Introduce sample with prose description plus table.

> "Table 1 presents selected characteristics of our participants."

### 3. Recruitment Channels Named
List specific channels used for recruitment.

> "Participants were recruited from a number of organizations, some of which actively engaged in [activity], while others focused purely on [other activity]."

### 4. Topic Areas Listed
Provide numbered or bulleted list of interview guide areas.

> "The interview guide asked questions about: 1) career pathways; 2) organizational experiences; and 3) professional identity."

### 5. Duration with Bounds
Report duration as range with meaningful bounds.

> "Interviews lasted between 45 minutes and two hours."

### 6. Multi-Round Coding
Describe iterative coding process with some specificity.

> "Analysis involved a two-step process of coding. Initial coding revolved around reading each transcript in its entirety and developing broad thematic codes. Initial coding was then followed by a second step of more focused line-by-line coding."

### 7. Conditional Positionality
Include positionality when interviewer-respondent mismatch is notable.

> "The interview team was white and majority female, with two male interviewers, while our respondents were all Black. We did not purposely match interviewer and respondent characteristics."

### 8. Sampling Logic Articulated
Explain the reasoning behind sampling approach.

> "We 'sampled for range' (Weiss 1995), attempting to at least partially capture the experiences of minority sub-groups within the broader population."

---

## Prohibited Moves (Don't Do This)

### 1. Excessive Case Justification
Do not spend >200 words justifying case selection unless comparative.

**Why**: Extended justification signals Detailed pathway complexity.

### 2. Full Respondent Tables
Do not list all individual respondents (use aggregate demographics).

**Why**: Detailed pathway move; Standard uses summary tables.

### 3. Variable Operationalization
This is not a quantitative methods section; avoid quasi-experimental framing unless truly necessary.

**Why**: Interview methods sections don't "operationalize" variables.

### 4. Extensive Ethical Considerations
Unless population is vulnerable, keep ethics to consent/IRB mention.

**Why**: Extended ethics signals vulnerable population requiring Detailed pathway.

### 5. Prevalence Statistics for Qualitative Themes
Save for Detailed pathway.

**Why**: Reporting "25% mentioned X" requires more methodological justification.

### 6. Multiple Tables
One table maximum in methods body.

**Why**: Multiple tables signal Detailed pathway complexity.

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Balanced coverage** | All components receive proportional attention |
| **Clear flow** | Natural progression from sample to recruitment to protocol to analysis |
| **Table that adds value** | Demographics presented efficiently |

## Table Design Guidance

### When to Include a Table
- Sample N > 30
- Multiple demographic dimensions matter for interpretation
- Sample composition is crucial for claims
- Want to save word count (table replaces ~200 words of prose)

### Standard Table Structure

| Characteristic | N (%) |
|----------------|-------|
| **Gender** | |
| Women | X (%) |
| Men | Y (%) |
| **Race/Ethnicity** | |
| White | X (%) |
| Black | Y (%) |
| Hispanic | Z (%) |
| **Age** | |
| Mean (range) | X (Y-Z) |

### Table Placement
- Reference in text before table appears
- Can be in appendix (reference as "Appendix Table 1")
- Keep in methods body if central to interpretation

---

## Positionality Decision

Include positionality (~150 words) when:
- [ ] Interviewer-respondent race/ethnicity mismatch
- [ ] Interviewer-respondent gender mismatch (if relevant to topic)
- [ ] Researcher studied own community (insider status)
- [ ] Topic involves sensitive disclosures
- [ ] Identity shaped access or rapport

Omit positionality when:
- No significant identity mismatch
- Access was straightforward
- Topic is not particularly sensitive
- Characteristics are aligned or not relevant

---

## Upgrade Triggers

Consider upgrading to Detailed pathway when:
- Population is vulnerable or marginalized
- Design becomes multi-site or comparative
- Sample exceeds 100 interviews
- Access required significant negotiation
- Reviewer requests more transparency

## Downgrade Triggers

Consider downgrading to Efficient pathway when:
- Strict word limits prohibit expansion
- Methods are genuinely secondary to contribution
- Study replicates established approach
