# Phase 1: Drafting

You are executing Phase 1 of methods-writer. Your goal is to write a complete Methods section following the selected pathway template and word allocation.

## Why This Phase Matters

Methods sections must accomplish multiple goals: establish credibility, provide replication information, acknowledge limitations, and do so within strict word constraints. This phase transforms the pathway template into prose that matches the conventions of *Social Problems* and *Social Forces*.

## Inputs

Before starting, gather:
1. Assessment memo from Phase 0 (pathway selection, optional components)
2. User's study details (sample, recruitment, protocol, analysis)
3. Pathway profile from `pathways/[pathway].md`
4. Component checklist from `techniques/component-checklist.md`
5. Opening moves from `techniques/opening-moves.md`

---

## Your Tasks

### 1. Follow the Pathway Structure

Each pathway has a specific word allocation. Match your draft to these targets:

#### EFFICIENT PATHWAY (~700 words)
```
[Opening + Study Overview]     ~150 words
[Sample + Recruitment]         ~200 words
[Protocol]                     ~150 words
[Analysis]                     ~150 words
[Confidentiality close]        ~50 words
```

#### STANDARD PATHWAY (~1,350 words)
```
[Opening + Study Framing]      ~150 words
[Sample Overview + Table]      ~300 words
[Recruitment Process]          ~200 words
[Protocol]                     ~250 words
[Analysis]                     ~250 words
[Optional: Positionality]      ~150 words
[Optional: Transition]         ~50 words
```

#### DETAILED PATHWAY (~2,500 words)
```
[Study Overview + Design]      ~300 words
[Case/Site Description]        ~250 words
[Sample with Table(s)]         ~400 words
[Recruitment Process]          ~350 words
[Protocol]                     ~350 words
[Ethical Considerations]       ~200 words (if vulnerable)
[Positionality]                ~200 words
[Analysis]                     ~350 words
[Limitations/Transition]       ~100 words
```

### 2. Draft the Opening

Use a **study-led opening** (88% of corpus). Lead with your data, not methodological justification.

**Preferred patterns**:

- **Direct data introduction**:
  > "I draw from [N] in-depth interviews with [population]."

- **Study framing + data**:
  > "This study draws on [N] interviews conducted with [population] between [dates]."

- **Conceptual frame + data** (Standard/Detailed):
  > "While studies of [topic] have focused on [X], here we draw on [N] interviews to examine [Y]."

**Avoid** method-justification openings:
- "Qualitative methods are appropriate because..."
- "Interviews allow researchers to..."
- "To understand [topic], I used..."

See `techniques/opening-moves.md` for more patterns.

### 3. Draft Each Component

Work through components in order. For each, consult `techniques/component-checklist.md` for what to include.

#### A. Sample Size and Composition

**Required for all pathways**:
- Total N
- Basic demographics (gender, race/ethnicity, age range)

**Efficient**: Report in prose
> "The sample of [N] [population] was majority female (X percent) and included [demographic breakdown]."

**Standard**: Prose + table reference
> "Table 1 presents selected characteristics of our [N] participants."

**Detailed**: Table + comparison to population
> "Table 1 presents selected characteristics of our participants and compares them to estimates of the [broader population]."

#### B. Recruitment Strategy

**Name the approach** (snowball, purposive, convenience, stratified):
> "I used purposeful snowball sampling, recruiting from [channels]."

**Efficient**: One sentence describing approach.

**Standard**: Named approach + channels listed.
> "Participants were recruited through [organization A], [organization B], and snowball referrals."

**Detailed**: Channels + eligibility + response rates.
> "215 [group] were asked to participate; 75 refused, resulting in a final sample of 140."

#### C. Interview Protocol

**Format** (can be implicit): Semi-structured, in-depth, life history

**Duration** (required): Report range, optionally with average/median
> "Interviews lasted between 45 minutes and two hours."
> "Interviews ranged from one to three hours; the median was 97 minutes."

**Topics covered**:
- **Efficient**: Brief mention
  > "Interviews covered [topic A] and [topic B]."

- **Standard**: Listed
  > "The interview guide asked questions about: 1) [topic]; 2) [topic]; and 3) [topic]."

- **Detailed**: Listed with sample questions
  > "We began with broad questions such as '[exact question]?' and then asked..."

**Recording and transcription** (Standard/Detailed):
> "All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed."

**Location** (Standard/Detailed):
> "Interviews were conducted at libraries, cafes, and participants' homes."

**Compensation** (Standard/Detailed):
> "Participants received a $[X] gift card."

**Language** (if relevant):
> "Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish, depending on respondent preference."

#### D. Analysis Approach

**Name the approach with citation**:
> "Following an abductive approach (Timmermans and Tavory 2012)..."
> "I used grounded theory methods (Charmaz 2006)..."
> "We used flexible coding procedures (Deterding and Waters 2018)..."

**Software** (Standard/Detailed):
> "Transcripts were coded using Dedoose."
> "Interview transcripts were analyzed in ATLAS.ti."

**Coding process**:
- **Efficient**: Named approach only
  > "Following an abductive approach (Timmermans and Tavory 2012), I coded using Dedoose."

- **Standard**: Process described
  > "Analysis involved a two-step process. Initial coding revolved around reading each transcript in its entirety... followed by focused line-by-line coding."

- **Detailed**: Process + specific codes
  > "These codes included *trust, rejection, loneliness, shame*, among others."

**Intercoder reliability** (Detailed, if team):
> "All transcripts were coded by at least two research team members and reviewed weekly."

#### E. Positionality (Optional, 17% of corpus)

**Include when**: Identity mismatch, vulnerable population, identity shaped access.

**Structure**:
1. Identity disclosure (brief)
2. How identity may have constrained data
3. How identity may have enabled data
4. Mitigation strategies (if applicable)

**Example**:
> "The interview team was white and majority female, while our respondents were all Black. It is important to recognize that this positionality may have restricted the stories our interviewees felt able to tell. Yet it may also have provoked narrations particularly relevant to our research questions."

#### F. Ethical Considerations (Detailed, if vulnerable population)

**Include**: IRB, consent process, information security, what was NOT asked.

**Example**:
> "Because some participants were still being adjudicated, we did not want them to disclose any information that could jeopardize their case. For this reason, we obtained verbal rather than written consent and did not maintain records of personal information."

#### G. Confidentiality Close (Efficient/Standard)

**Brief**:
> "For the sake of confidentiality, all respondents' names have been changed."
> "To ensure confidentiality, I have used pseudonyms throughout."

### 4. Calibrate Word Count

After drafting, check word count against targets:

| Pathway | Target | Acceptable Range |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| Efficient | 700 | 600-900 |
| Standard | 1,350 | 1,200-1,500 |
| Detailed | 2,500 | 2,000-3,000 |

If over target:
- Cut method justification (readers assume interviews are appropriate)
- Move demographics to table
- Compress recruitment channel descriptions

If under target:
- Add recruitment channel detail
- Expand analysis process description
- Add location/compensation if omitted

### 5. Avoid Common Errors

**Do NOT**:
- Claim saturation (only 4% of corpus does this)
- Use method-justification openings
- Include positionality by default (only 17%)
- Over-specify coding rounds without purpose
- Include response rates unless relevant

**DO**:
- Open with the study/sample
- Name the analysis approach with citation
- Report duration as range
- Include table reference if using table
- End with confidentiality note (Efficient/Standard)

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Study-Led, Not Method-Justified
Lead with what you did, not why interviews are good. 88% of corpus does this.

### 2. Match Pathway to Content
Follow the word allocation. Don't write 2,500 words for a Standard study.

### 3. Tables Save Words
A demographic table can replace 200+ words of prose. Use tables when N > 30 or composition matters.

### 4. Saturation Alternatives
If asked about stopping criteria, offer alternatives:
- "Continued until key themes emerged across subgroups"
- "Sample size reflects comparative considerations"
- "Recruitment ended when [pragmatic bound]"

### 5. Named Approaches Require Citations
If you name an approach (abductive, grounded theory, flexible coding), cite it.

## Output Files to Create

1. **methods-draft.md** - Complete Methods section
2. **drafting-notes.md** - Notes on word count, components included/omitted, areas needing revision

## When You're Done

Report to the orchestrator:
- Draft complete (yes/no)
- Word count achieved vs. target
- Components included
- Components omitted (with rationale)
- Areas flagged for revision

Example summary:
> "**Draft complete**. 1,312 words (target: 1,350). Standard pathway. Included: sample with table reference, recruitment, protocol, analysis process. Omitted: positionality (no identity mismatch), ethical considerations (not vulnerable). Flagged: transition from analysis to findings could be smoother. Ready for Phase 2: Revision."
