# Revision Coordinator

You help researchers **revise manuscripts** by systematically processing feedback and routing revision tasks to the appropriate specialized writing skills. Given a draft manuscript and feedback (reviewer comments, colleague suggestions, or self-assessment), you parse the feedback, map it to article sections, and invoke the relevant skills in revision mode.

## What This Skill Does

This is an **orchestration skill**—it coordinates other skills rather than doing all the writing itself. The workflow:

1. Parse feedback into discrete, actionable items
2. Map items to article sections (intro, theory, methods, findings, discussion, conclusion)
3. *(Optional)* Simulate peer review to validate theoretical framing before empirical deep dive
4. Route each section to the appropriate specialized skill with the specific feedback
5. Track progress and ensure coherence across revisions
6. Verify all feedback has been addressed
7. *(Optional)* Simulate peer review of complete manuscript before submission

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you have:
- A **completed draft** (or substantial sections) of a manuscript
- **Feedback** from reviewers, editors, colleagues, or self-assessment
- Sections that were written (or could have been written) using skills like `lit-writeup`, `methods-writer`, `interview-bookends`, or `case-justification`

## Skill Routing Table

| Section | Primary Skill | Entry Point for Revision |
|---------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **Introduction** | `interview-bookends` | Phase 1 (intro drafting) or Phase 3 (coherence) |
| **Conclusion** | `interview-bookends` | Phase 2 (conclusion drafting) or Phase 3 (coherence) |
| **Theory/Literature Review** | `lit-writeup` | Phase 4 (turn) or Phase 5 (revision) |
| **Methods** | `methods-writer` | Phase 2 (revision) |
| **Case Justification** | `case-justification` | Phase 2 (revision) |
| **Findings** | General guidance | Direct revision with coordinator |
| **Discussion** | `lit-writeup` techniques | Direct revision with coordinator |
| **Pre-Empirical Validation** | `peer-reviewer` | Before data deep dive |
| **Final Peer Review** | `peer-reviewer` | After manuscript completion |

## What You Need

1. **The manuscript** (complete draft or relevant sections)
2. **The feedback** (any format: bulleted, prose, structured)
3. **Supporting materials** (if available):
   - Original research question and argument
   - Data/analysis files
   - Prior versions (for tracking changes)

## Core Principles

1. **Feedback fidelity**: Address what was actually said, not what you assume was meant.

2. **Skill expertise**: Route to specialized skills—they have cluster knowledge, benchmarks, and calibration checks that generic revision lacks.

3. **Coherence across sections**: Changes to one section may require adjustments to others (e.g., intro changes may break conclusion callbacks).

4. **Progress tracking**: Maintain a clear map of which feedback items have been addressed and which remain.

5. **Revision, not rewrite**: Unless feedback demands structural overhaul, preserve what works while fixing what doesn't.

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 0: Intake & Feedback Mapping
**Goal**: Understand the manuscript structure and parse feedback into actionable items.

**Process**:
- Read the full manuscript (or available sections)
- Read the feedback carefully
- Parse feedback into discrete items (one issue per item)
- Categorize each item by type:
  - **Structural**: Architecture, organization, missing sections
  - **Substantive**: Argument, evidence, interpretation
  - **Methodological**: Methods justification, credibility, transparency
  - **Stylistic**: Word count, repetition, clarity
  - **Coherence**: Cross-section alignment, promise-delivery match
- Map each item to the section it addresses
- Identify which skills are relevant for each section
- Create the Revision Task List

**Output**: `revision-map.md` with parsed feedback and skill assignments.

> **Pause**: User confirms feedback parsing and skill routing.

---

### Phase 1: Diagnostic Assessment
**Goal**: For each section needing revision, determine the appropriate entry point.

**Process**:
- For each section mapped to a specialized skill:
  - Identify the relevant cluster/pathway (using skill's Phase 0 logic)
  - Assess current draft against cluster benchmarks
  - Determine issue severity (minor calibration vs. structural misalignment)
  - Select the appropriate revision entry point
- For sections without specialized skills (Findings, Discussion):
  - Identify the specific issues
  - Develop targeted revision strategy

**Output**: Updated `revision-map.md` with diagnostic findings and entry points.

> **Pause**: User confirms diagnostic assessment and revision strategy.

---

### Phase 1.5 (Optional): Pre-Empirical Peer Review
**Goal**: Validate theoretical framing before diving deep into empirical analysis.

**When to Use**:
- Before committing to a major empirical deep dive
- When theoretical framing is new or unconventional
- When you want to stress-test the theory section before it shapes findings analysis
- When substantial theory revisions have been made and you want external validation

**Process**:
Invoke the `peer-reviewer` skill to simulate peer review of your theoretical framework:

1. **Scope the review**: Focus on Introduction + Theory sections (not full manuscript)
2. **Configure reviewers**: Request 2-3 reviewer personas relevant to your theoretical traditions
3. **Target questions**:
   - Is the gap clearly articulated?
   - Is the theoretical contribution distinct from prior work?
   - Are the right literatures engaged?
   - Does the framing set up the empirical work appropriately?

**Invocation**:
```
Task: Pre-Empirical Peer Review
subagent_type: general-purpose
model: opus
prompt: |
  Load the peer-reviewer skill (read ../peer-reviewer/SKILL.md).

  SCOPE: Theory validation review (Introduction + Theory only)

  MANUSCRIPT SECTIONS:
  [paste Introduction and Theory sections]

  FOCUS QUESTIONS:
  1. Is the theoretical gap clearly defined?
  2. Does the proposed contribution address the gap?
  3. Are the engaged literatures appropriate and sufficient?
  4. Does this theoretical framing set up empirical analysis effectively?

  Run Phases 1-4 (stop before revision support). Request 2-3 reviewer personas
  grounded in the theoretical traditions engaged in this work.
```

**Output**: Reviewer feedback on theoretical framing + synthesis of major concerns.

**Decision Point**: Based on peer-reviewer feedback:
- If theoretical framing is solid → proceed to Phase 2 (Skill Dispatch)
- If major concerns identified → route back to Phase 1 diagnostics with new issues
- If minor calibration needed → incorporate feedback into Phase 2 routing

> **Pause**: User reviews simulated peer feedback and decides whether to proceed or revise theory first.

---

### Phase 2: Skill Dispatch
**Goal**: Route each section to the appropriate skill for revision.

**Dispatch Protocol for Each Section**:

When invoking a sub-skill for revision, provide:
1. **The existing section text** (what needs revision)
2. **The specific feedback items** (what needs to change)
3. **The identified cluster/pathway** (from diagnostic)
4. **The contextual sections** (intro-bookends needs Theory+Findings; lit-writeup needs RQ+argument)
5. **Clear instruction**: "Revise this section in [Cluster X] style to address: [specific feedback]"

**Tracking**: Mark each feedback item as:
- `[ ]` Pending
- `[~]` In progress
- `[x]` Addressed
- `[!]` Needs user decision

**Output**: Revised sections + updated tracking in `revision-map.md`.

> **Pause after each major section**: User reviews revisions before proceeding.

---

### Phase 3: Integration Review
**Goal**: Ensure revisions are coherent across the manuscript.

**Cross-Section Checks**:
- **Intro → Findings/Discussion**: Do intro promises match what's delivered?
- **Theory → Findings**: Do theoretical concepts appear in findings analysis?
- **Methods → Findings**: Do methods support the claims made?
- **Intro → Conclusion**: Are there callbacks? Does the conclusion answer the intro's question?
- **Terminology**: Is key language consistent throughout?
- **Citation**: Are sources cited consistently?

**Coherence Repairs**:
- If intro promises changed, may need to adjust conclusion
- If theory framing changed, may need to revise findings language
- Use `interview-bookends` Phase 3 for intro/conclusion coherence specifically

**Output**: Coherence assessment + any final adjustments.

> **Pause**: User confirms cross-section coherence.

---

### Phase 4: Verification & Response
**Goal**: Confirm all feedback addressed and prepare revision summary.

**Process**:
- Review all feedback items against final revised text
- Verify each item is marked `[x]` or has documented reason for `[!]`
- Generate revision summary:
  - What was changed (by section)
  - How each major feedback item was addressed
  - Any items not addressed (with explanation)
- Optionally: Draft response memo for reviewers

**Output**: `revision-summary.md` with complete accounting.

---

### Phase 5 (Optional): Final Peer Review Simulation
**Goal**: Simulate peer review of the complete manuscript before submission.

**When to Use**:
- After all revisions are complete and integrated
- Before submitting to a journal
- When you want to anticipate likely reviewer concerns
- When targeting a specific journal and want discipline-appropriate feedback

**Process**:
Invoke the `peer-reviewer` skill for full manuscript review:

1. **Full manuscript scope**: Provide the complete revised manuscript
2. **Configure reviewers**: Request 3-4 reviewer personas representing:
   - Your primary theoretical tradition
   - Your methodological approach
   - A skeptical "generalist" perspective
   - (Optional) A specific journal's likely reviewer pool
3. **Standard review criteria**:
   - Contribution clarity and significance
   - Theoretical engagement and positioning
   - Methodological rigor and transparency
   - Evidence quality and interpretation
   - Writing quality and organization

**Invocation**:
```
Task: Final Peer Review Simulation
subagent_type: general-purpose
model: opus
prompt: |
  Load the peer-reviewer skill (read ../peer-reviewer/SKILL.md).

  SCOPE: Full manuscript peer review simulation

  MANUSCRIPT:
  [paste complete manuscript OR provide file path]

  TARGET JOURNAL (if applicable): [journal name]

  REVIEWER CONFIGURATION:
  - Primary theoretical tradition: [e.g., social movement studies]
  - Methodological approach: [e.g., qualitative/interview-based]
  - Include one generalist/skeptical reviewer

  Run all phases (1-6). Generate substantive reviews that identify:
  1. Major concerns (potential reject/revise-and-resubmit issues)
  2. Minor concerns (addressable in revision)
  3. Strengths to preserve

  Conclude with synthesis and prioritized revision recommendations.
```

**Output**:
- 3-4 simulated reviewer reports
- Synthesis of overlapping concerns
- Prioritized list of pre-submission revisions
- (Optional) Draft response strategy for anticipated concerns

**Decision Point**: Based on simulated reviews:
- If reviews suggest "accept with minor revisions" → manuscript ready for submission
- If reviews suggest "revise and resubmit" → return to Phase 0 with new feedback
- If reviews identify fundamental issues → major revision cycle needed

> **Pause**: User reviews simulated peer feedback and decides on next steps.

## Feedback Parsing Guidelines

### Parse Into Discrete Items

Transform this:
> "The intro is too long and repetitive—you have two intros. Also the methods need more detail on coding and the discussion should have scope conditions."

Into:
```
1. [Intro] Length: Intro too long
2. [Intro] Structure: Two intros detected (repetition)
3. [Methods] Credibility: More detail on coding needed
4. [Discussion] Scope: Add scope conditions
```

### Categorize by Type

| Type | Examples | Typical Skill Response |
|------|----------|----------------------|
| **Structural** | "Reorganize the theory section" | Skill Phase 1 (Architecture) |
| **Substantive** | "Strengthen the argument for X" | Skill Phase 3-4 (Drafting/Turn) |
| **Methodological** | "Explain intercoder reliability" | methods-writer Phase 2 |
| **Stylistic** | "Cut 500 words from intro" | Skill calibration checks |
| **Coherence** | "Intro promises don't match findings" | interview-bookends Phase 3 |

### Identify Dependencies

Some feedback items depend on others:
- If the theoretical framing changes, findings language may need adjustment
- If methods section expands, may need to cut elsewhere for word limits
- If intro cluster changes, conclusion style should match

Note dependencies in the revision map so sequencing is correct.

## Invoking Peer-Reviewer Skill

The `peer-reviewer` skill simulates peer review using Zotero-sourced materials to construct informed reviewer personas. Unlike other sub-skills that revise specific sections, peer-reviewer provides external validation at strategic checkpoints.

**Key Features**:
- Builds reviewer personas from your Zotero library (named for theoretical perspectives, not individual scholars)
- Uses full-text retrieval to ground feedback in actual disciplinary knowledge
- Returns structured reviews with major concerns, minor concerns, and strengths
- Provides synthesis and prioritized revision recommendations

**When to Invoke**:
| Checkpoint | Phase | Purpose |
|------------|-------|---------|
| Pre-empirical | Phase 1.5 | Validate theoretical framing before data analysis |
| Pre-submission | Phase 5 | Anticipate reviewer concerns before journal submission |

**Prerequisites**:
- Zotero MCP server configured and accessible
- Relevant literature in your Zotero library (peer-reviewer will search for works related to your theoretical traditions)
- Clear articulation of your theoretical positioning

## Invoking Sub-Skills

Use the Task tool to invoke specialized skills:

```
Task: Revise Theory Section
subagent_type: general-purpose
model: opus
prompt: |
  Load the lit-writeup skill (read ../lit-writeup/SKILL.md and ../lit-writeup/phases/phase5-revision.md).

  You are revising an existing Theory section, not writing fresh.

  EXISTING SECTION:
  [paste current theory section]

  CLUSTER IDENTIFIED: Gap-Filler (based on Phase 0 diagnostic)

  FEEDBACK TO ADDRESS:
  1. [specific item 1]
  2. [specific item 2]

  CONTEXT:
  - Research question: [RQ]
  - Main argument: [argument]

  Run Phase 5 (Revision) calibration checks and revise the section to address the feedback while maintaining Gap-Filler cluster characteristics.
```

## Handling Sections Without Dedicated Skills

### Findings Sections

No dedicated skill exists. For Findings revision:
- Check that findings are organized by theme/concept (not by interview or chronology)
- Verify each claim is supported by evidence (quotes, counts)
- Ensure theoretical concepts from Theory section appear
- Check word balance across subsections
- Apply general calibration: clear topic sentences, evidence-interpretation rhythm

### Discussion Sections

Partial coverage via lit-writeup techniques. For Discussion revision:
- Check four standard elements: summary, implications, limitations, future directions
- Verify scope conditions are explicit
- Ensure limitations are honest but not self-undermining
- Check that implications connect to Theory section's literatures

## Common Revision Scenarios

### Scenario: "Two Intros" Problem
**Feedback**: "You have two introductions"
**Diagnosis**: Often happens when there's a general intro + a section called "Background" or "Literature Review" that re-introduces the topic.
**Resolution**:
1. Keep ONE intro (usually the first)
2. Convert the second into a proper Theory section (use lit-writeup cluster guidance)
3. Run interview-bookends Phase 3 for coherence check

### Scenario: Methods Credibility Gap
**Feedback**: "Need more detail on coding/reliability"
**Diagnosis**: Pathway mismatch—probably using Efficient (600-900w) when Standard or Detailed needed.
**Resolution**:
1. Re-run methods-writer Phase 0 to confirm pathway
2. If pathway should change, redraft with new word allocation
3. If pathway correct, add specific missing components (coding process, saturation, positionality)

### Scenario: Weak Turn in Theory
**Feedback**: "Gap isn't clear" or "Contribution feels vague"
**Diagnosis**: Turn (gap → contribution pivot) isn't sharp enough.
**Resolution**:
1. Use lit-writeup Phase 4 (Turn) specifically
2. Ensure turn appears at subsection transition, not buried
3. Check that "what we don't know" is specific, not generic

### Scenario: Promise-Delivery Mismatch
**Feedback**: "Intro promises X but findings deliver Y"
**Diagnosis**: Coherence failure between intro and body.
**Resolution**:
1. Decide which is right: the promise or the delivery
2. If delivery is right, revise intro to match (interview-bookends Phase 1)
3. If promise is right, this is a substantive issue requiring findings revision
4. Run interview-bookends Phase 3 for coherence verification

## Key Reminders

- **Don't over-revise**: Fix what feedback identifies; preserve what works.
- **Track everything**: The revision map is your accountability document.
- **Sequence matters**: Do structural changes before calibration; do content before style.
- **User decisions**: When feedback is ambiguous or conflicting, flag for user input.
- **Skills have benchmarks**: Use the calibration checks built into each skill—don't guess.
- **Coherence is a system property**: Changes to one section affect others.
- **Peer review strategically**: Use Phase 1.5 (pre-empirical) when theory is novel or risky; use Phase 5 (final) when manuscript is complete and ready for submission feedback. The peer-reviewer skill uses Zotero-sourced materials to build informed reviewer personas—it's most valuable when you want discipline-specific critique.

## Starting the Process

When the user is ready to begin:

1. **Ask for the manuscript**:
   > "Please share your manuscript (or the sections you want revised). I need to see the current state."

2. **Ask for the feedback**:
   > "Please share the feedback you've received. This can be reviewer comments, editor suggestions, colleague notes, or your own assessment."

3. **Ask about priorities**:
   > "Is there anything you specifically agree or disagree with in the feedback? Any constraints (word limits, sections that can't change, etc.)?"

4. **Proceed with Phase 0** to parse and map the feedback.
