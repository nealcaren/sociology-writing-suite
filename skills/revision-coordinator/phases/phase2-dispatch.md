# Phase 2: Skill Dispatch

## Why This Phase Matters

This is where revision actually happens. Based on the diagnostic assessment, you now invoke specialized skills to revise each section. The key is providing each skill with the right context so it can do its job effectively.

## Dispatch Principles

1. **One section at a time**: Complete each section before moving to the next (unless dependencies require otherwise)

2. **Full context provision**: Skills need more than just "fix this"—they need the existing text, the specific feedback, and the cluster/pathway information

3. **Track as you go**: Update the revision map after each section is completed

4. **User checkpoints**: After each major section, pause for user review

## Dispatch Protocols by Skill

### Interview-Bookends Dispatch (Introduction or Conclusion)

**What to provide the skill**:

```markdown
## Revision Request: [Introduction/Conclusion]

### Skill: interview-bookends
### Phase: [1 for intro, 2 for conclusion, 3 for coherence check]

### Cluster Identified
[Gap-Filler / Theory-Extension / Concept-Building / Synthesis / Problem-Driven]

### Current Section
[Paste the current introduction or conclusion]

### Feedback Items to Address
1. [ID: I-1] [Specific feedback item]
2. [ID: I-2] [Specific feedback item]

### Required Context
**Theory section summary** (for intro) or **full theory section** (for conclusion callbacks):
[Paste or summarize]

**Findings section summary**:
[Key findings that intro should promise and conclusion should reference]

**Current conclusion** (if revising intro, for coherence):
[Paste current conclusion so intro can set up callbacks]

### Constraints
- Word limit: [if any]
- Elements that must be preserved: [if any]
- Journal requirements: [if any]

### Instructions
Revise this [introduction/conclusion] to address the feedback items while maintaining [Cluster] style. Ensure:
- Opening move matches cluster type
- [For intro] Promises align with what findings deliver
- [For conclusion] Callbacks to intro language are present
- Contribution is explicit and specific
```

### Current Section
[Paste the current theory/literature section]

### Feedback Items to Address
1. [ID: T-1] [Specific feedback item]
2. [ID: T-2] [Specific feedback item]

### Required Context

| Citation density | ~24/1000 words | [current] |
| Subsections | 2-4 | [current] |

### Instructions
Revise this theory section to address the feedback items while maintaining [Cluster] style. Ensure:
- Turn (gap → contribution) is explicit and well-positioned
- Each subsection has clear function in the arc
- [Cluster-specific requirement, e.g., "gap is framed as absence, not criticism"]
- Calibration targets are met
```

|--------|---------------------|
| Word count | [pathway target] |
| Table | [expected?] |
| Positionality | [triggered?] |

### Instructions

### Direct Revision Dispatch (Findings, Discussion)

For sections without dedicated skills, provide structured guidance:

```markdown
## Revision Request: [Findings/Discussion]

### Approach: Direct revision with guidance

### Current Section
[Paste the current section]

### Feedback Items to Address
1. [ID: F-1] [Specific feedback item]
2. [ID: F-2] [Specific feedback item]

### Revision Guidelines

**For Findings**:
- Organization: By theme/concept (not by interview or chronology)
- Evidence: Each claim supported by quote or count
- Interpretation: Evidence → interpretation rhythm maintained
- Theoretical language: Concepts from theory section appear
- Balance: Subsections roughly proportional (unless justified)

**For Discussion**:
- Summary: Brief recap of main findings (not repetition)
- Implications: How findings advance theory/literature
- Scope conditions: Explicit boundaries on claims
- Limitations: Honest but not self-undermining
- Future directions: 2-3 specific suggestions (optional)

### Context
**From theory section** (concepts that should appear):
[List key theoretical concepts]

**From findings** (claims discussion should interpret):
[List main findings]

### Instructions
Revise this section to address the feedback items. Maintain:
- Clear topic sentences for each paragraph
- Evidence-interpretation rhythm
- Appropriate hedging for claims
```

## Dispatch Sequencing

Follow the sequence established in Phase 1, respecting dependencies:

### Typical Sequence

1. **Theory section first** (if changing) — This is the foundation
2. **Methods** (usually independent) — Can often run parallel to theory
3. **Case justification** (if needed) — May depend on theory framing
4. **Findings** (if changing) — May need terminology updates from theory
5. **Introduction** — After theory and findings settled
6. **Discussion** — After findings settled
7. **Conclusion** — Last, after intro finalized

### Dependency Handling

If dependencies exist:
- Complete the upstream section first
- Note what changed that affects downstream sections
- Provide changed context to downstream skills

**Example**: If theory framing changed from Gap-Filler to Theory-Extension:
1. Complete theory revision
2. Before dispatching intro, note: "Theory cluster changed to Theory-Extension; intro should match"
3. When dispatching conclusion, include revised intro for callback alignment

## Tracking Progress

After each dispatch, update `revision-map.md`:

```markdown
### Dispatch Log

| Time | Section | Skill/Phase | Items Addressed | Status |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| [timestamp] | Theory | lit-writeup/P5 | T-1, T-2, T-3 | Complete |
| [timestamp] | Methods | methods-writer/P1 | M-1, M-2 | Complete |
| [timestamp] | Introduction | interview-bookends/P1 | I-1, I-2 | In progress |

### Item Status Update

| ID | Original Status | Current Status | Notes |
|----|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| T-1 | [ ] | [x] | Word count reduced by 300 |
| T-2 | [ ] | [x] | Turn sharpened, moved to end of section |
| T-3 | [ ] | [x] | "Organizational absorption" defined in para 2 |
| M-1 | [ ] | [x] | Coding process expanded |
| M-2 | [ ] | [x] | Pathway changed to Detailed |
| I-1 | [ ] | [~] | In progress |
| I-2 | [ ] | [~] | In progress |
```

## User Checkpoints

After completing each major section, pause:

> **Section Complete: [Theory Section]**
>
> Changes made:
> - [Summary of changes]
>
> Feedback items addressed:
> - T-1: [how addressed]
> - T-2: [how addressed]
>
> Next section: [Introduction]
>
> Ready to proceed?

## Handling Problems

### Skill Can't Fully Address Feedback

If a skill's revision doesn't fully address a feedback item:
- Document what was addressed vs. what remains
- Flag item as `[~]` (partially addressed) or `[!]` (needs user decision)
- Note the gap for Phase 4 verification

### Contradictory Feedback

If R1 and R2 give contradictory feedback:
- Do NOT resolve this yourself
- Flag as `[!]` with both options documented
- Ask user which direction to take
- Proceed with user's choice

### Scope Creep

If addressing feedback reveals additional issues:
- Add new items to the revision map
- Flag as "emerged during revision"
- Prioritize: address if directly related, defer if tangential

## Output Files

For each dispatched section, save:
- `section-revisions/[section]-revised.md` — The revised section text
- Update `revision-map.md` — Tracking updates

## When You're Done

After all sections have been dispatched and revised:

Summarize for the orchestrator:
- Sections revised
- Items addressed per section
- Any items requiring user decision (`[!]`)
- Any dependencies that need Phase 3 attention

**Example summary**:
> Dispatch complete. 6 sections revised:
> - Theory: 3/3 items addressed
> - Methods: 2/2 items addressed (pathway changed to Detailed)
> - Introduction: 2/2 items addressed
> - Findings: 1/1 item addressed
> - Discussion: 2/2 items addressed
> - Conclusion: 1/1 item addressed
>
> All items marked complete except D-1 (scope conditions) flagged [!] — user needs to confirm which scope conditions are appropriate.
>
> Ready for Phase 3 integration review.

Then proceed to Phase 3.
