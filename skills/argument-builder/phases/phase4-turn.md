# Phase 4: Turn Refinement

## Why This Phase Matters

The turn is the rhetorical center of your Theory section—the moment you pivot from "what we know" to "what we don't know" and create space for your contribution. A weak turn undermines the entire section; a strong turn makes your contribution memorable. This phase ensures the turn is specific, compelling, and tightly connected to your research questions.

## Your Tasks

### 1. Extract Current Turn

From the draft, identify:
- The turn paragraph(s)
- The specific turn sentence(s)
- The sentence before the turn (what it acknowledges)
- The sentence after the turn (how it connects to your study)

### 2. Evaluate Against the 4-Part Formula

Check that the turn includes all four elements:

| Part | Function | Your Turn |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Acknowledge** | What we know | [Extract] |
| **Pivot** | Contrastive marker | [Extract] |
| **Gap** | What we don't know | [Extract] |
| **Connect** | Your study | [Extract] |

If any part is weak or missing, draft improvements.

### 3. Test Gap Specificity

The gap must be specific, not generic. Evaluate:

**Weak (Generic) Gap Tests**:
- "More research is needed" → Too vague
- "We don't fully understand" → What specifically?
- "This area is understudied" → Which aspect?
- "Scholars have not examined" → What exactly?

**Strong (Specific) Gap Tests**:
- Specifies WHAT is unknown
- Specifies AMONG WHOM (population)
- Specifies UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS (context)
- Explains WHY THIS MATTERS

**Specificity Template**:
> "We know little about **[what specifically]** among **[which population]** when **[under what conditions]** despite **[why this matters]**."

### 4. Check Gap-Question Alignment

The gap must directly motivate your research questions.

**Alignment Test**: Can you draw a straight line from gap to question?

| Gap Claim | Research Question | Aligned? |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| "We know little about X among Y" | "How do Y experience X?" | ✓ Yes |
| "We know little about X" | "Why does Z happen?" | ✗ No |

If misaligned, revise either the gap or the questions.

### 5. Calibrate Turn Confidence

The gap claim should be assertive (you're stating what the literature has NOT done), but not overclaimed.

**Appropriate Confidence**:
> "Yet we know little about..."
> "However, less attention has been paid to..."
> "Scholars have not examined..."

**Over-Claimed (Avoid)**:
> "No one has ever studied..."
> "The literature completely ignores..."
> "We know nothing about..."

**Under-Hedged Definition (Also Avoid)**:
> "It may be that we don't fully understand..."
> "Perhaps less attention has been paid to..."

### 6. Evaluate Turn Placement

Is the turn in the right location?

| Cluster | Expected Placement | Paragraph Location |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Gap-Filler | Middle | P3-4 of ~6 |
| Theory-Extender | Middle | P4-5 of ~8 |
| Concept-Builder | Middle | After critique, before new concept |
| Synthesis | Middle | After both traditions |
| Problem-Driven | Variable | Early for debate, late for empirical |

**Too Early**: Gap feels unmotivated; insufficient synthesis precedes
**Too Late**: Reader lost the thread; synthesis felt aimless
**Just Right**: Gap emerges naturally from what precedes

### 7. Refine the Turn Sentence

Craft the turn sentence with precision:

**Turn Sentence Structure**:
```
[Acknowledge prior work]. [Pivot marker], [specific gap claim]. [Connect to your study].
```

**Example Refinement**:

Original (weak):
> "This literature is important, but there is still more to learn. This study examines mothers in doubled-up households."

Revised (strong):
> "This literature highlights the importance of housing context for family identity work. Yet while research documents how housing instability affects parenting, there is less attention to how mothers in doubled-up arrangements manage maternal identity when they lack spatial authority. This study examines how guest mothers negotiate identity and dignity in shared living arrangements."

### 8. Test the Turn

Run these diagnostic questions:

1. **Specificity**: Could this gap apply to many other studies, or is it specific to mine?
2. **Motivation**: Does the synthesis before genuinely build toward this gap?
3. **Connection**: Do my research questions directly address this gap?
4. **Placement**: Does the turn fall at the right structural moment?
5. **Confidence**: Is the gap claim appropriately assertive?
6. **Novelty**: Is this gap genuinely unstudied, or am I overclaiming?

### 9. Write Turn Refinement Memo

Create `turn-memo.md`:

```markdown
# Turn Refinement

## Original Turn
[Paste original turn paragraph]

## Analysis

### 4-Part Structure
- Acknowledge: [assessment]
- Pivot: [assessment]
- Gap: [assessment]
- Connect: [assessment]

### Specificity Assessment
[Is the gap specific enough? What would make it more specific?]

### Gap-Question Alignment
[Do questions directly follow from gap?]

### Placement Assessment
[Is turn in right location? Should it move?]

## Refined Turn

[Full refined paragraph]

### Turn Sentence (Isolated)
> "[The core turn sentence]"

## Changes Made
- [List specific changes]

## Context Adjustments Needed
[Any changes to paragraphs before/after the turn]
```

## Guiding Principles

### The Turn Is Your Thesis
If someone asks "What's your contribution?", you should be able to point to your turn sentence.

### Specificity > Scope
A narrow, specific gap is better than a broad, vague one. "We know little about X among Y in Z context" beats "This area is understudied."

### The Turn Isn't a Surprise
The synthesis before should build toward the gap. Readers should sense what's coming.

### The Turn Isn't Buried
Start the turn paragraph with the pivot. Don't bury the gap in the middle of a paragraph.

### One Gap, Not Many
Focus on the single gap your study addresses. Multiple gaps dilute the contribution.

## Common Turn Problems

| Problem | Symptom | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Generic gap | "More research needed" | Specify what, among whom, why |
| Multiple gaps | Lists 3-4 unknowns | Focus on one |
| Misaligned | Gap doesn't match questions | Revise gap or questions |
| Overclaimed | "No one has studied" | Acknowledge adjacent work |
| Buried | Pivot in middle of paragraph | Move to paragraph opening |
| Too late | Turn in final paragraph | Move earlier |
| Weak pivot | No contrastive marker | Add "However," "Yet" |

## Output Files to Create

1. **turn-memo.md** - Analysis and refined turn
2. **theory-section-draft-v2.md** - Updated draft with refined turn

## When You're Done

Report to the orchestrator:
- Original turn assessment (strong/weak/specific issues)
- Key refinements made
- Final turn sentence
- Gap-question alignment verified
- Placement confirmed

Example summary:
> "Turn refined. Original was generic ('housing dynamics remain understudied'). Refined to: **'Yet while research documents how housing instability affects parenting practices, there is less attention to how mothers in doubled-up arrangements manage maternal identity when they lack spatial authority over their children.'** Gap now specifies: (1) maternal identity (what), (2) guest mothers (who), (3) shared households without spatial authority (conditions). Directly motivates RQ1 about identity negotiation. Placement confirmed at P6 of 10. Ready for Phase 5: Revision."
