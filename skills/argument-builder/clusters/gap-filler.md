# Cluster 1: Gap-Filler Minimalist

**Prevalence**: 27.5% of articles (most common style)

## When to Use This Cluster

Use the Gap-Filler approach when:
- Your primary contribution is **empirical insight** about an understudied population, setting, or phenomenon
- You're not introducing new theoretical concepts
- You're not applying a named framework that needs extended exposition
- The theoretical context is established; you're filling in empirical specifics

**Best for**: Studies of understudied populations, new settings, descriptive research on underexamined processes.

## Distinguishing Features

| Feature | Gap-Filler Pattern |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Positioning Move** | Gap-filling |
| **Arc** | Funnel |
| **Subsections** | None or light (0-2) |
| **Literature Balance** | Balanced or substantive-heavy |
| **Visual Elements** | None |
| **Turn Placement** | Middle |
| **Hedging Level** | Moderate; assertive gap statements |

## Characteristic Paragraph Sequence

The standard Gap-Filler follows this 5-paragraph backbone (expand as needed):

1. **PROVIDE_CONTEXT** - Establish the phenomenon or population
2. **SYNTHESIZE** - Review existing findings on the topic
3. **SYNTHESIZE** - Additional synthesis (what we know)
4. **IDENTIFY_GAP** - Mark what remains unknown
5. **STATE_QUESTIONS** - Articulate research questions

This funnel structure moves from broad context → specific gap → your study.

## Signature Sentence Patterns

### Opening the Section
> "A growing body of research examines [phenomenon]..."
> "As [social condition] has [changed/expanded/intensified], scholars have..."
> "A burgeoning literature documents [pattern]..."

### Building Synthesis
> "Research shows [finding] (Author Year; Author Year)."
> "Studies consistently find [pattern]..."
> "This literature highlights the importance of [X]."

### Marking the Turn
> "Yet we know little about [specific aspect]."
> "However, less attention has been paid to [understudied dimension]."
> "What remains unclear is [specific question]."

### Stating Questions
> "This study examines [research question] by [method]."
> "I ask: [question]?"

## Citation Patterns

Gap-Fillers use **efficient parenthetical strings** for synthesis:
> "Research demonstrates X (Author 2020; Author 2019; Author 2018)."

**Minimal author-subject constructions** unless citing a canonical source:
> Avoid: "Jones (2019) argues that..."
> Prefer: "Studies show that... (Jones 2019)."

**Citation density**: Aim for 2.4-5.0 citations per paragraph (lower end of range is fine).

## Hedging Calibration

| Claim Type | Hedging Level |
|------------|---------------|
| Reporting prior findings | Moderate assertiveness ("studies demonstrate," "research shows") |
| Gap claim | **Assertive** ("we know little," "remains unexplored") |
| Your research questions | Unhedged (state directly) |
| Predictions about mechanisms | Hedge ("may," "might") |

Gap-Fillers should be **confident about the gap**. The turn is your strongest rhetorical move.

## Calibration Benchmarks (Cluster-Specific)

Based on Gap-Filler articles in the sample:

| Metric | Typical Range |
|--------|---------------|
| **Word count** | 1,000-1,400 (leaner than average) |
| **Paragraphs** | 6-10 |
| **Subsections** | 0-2 |
| **Citations** | 25-35 |
| **Literature balance** | 18% theory-heavy, 59% balanced, 23% substantive-heavy |

Gap-Fillers are **shorter and leaner** than other clusters. Don't over-elaborate.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Adding unnecessary subsections | Keep it streamlined; 0-2 max |
| Generic gap ("more research is needed") | Specify: "We don't know [X] about [Y] among [Z]" |
| Theory bloat | You're not extending theory; keep theoretical framing minimal |
| Turn arrives too late | Place the turn around paragraph 3-4, not at the end |
| Overclaiming the gap | Acknowledge what we DO know before the gap claim |

## Exemplar Articles

**10.1093_sf_soy093** - CPS Reporting as Surveillance
> Concise review of child welfare literature, identifies gap in understanding how reporting patterns affect families, no subsections, minimal theoretical framing beyond surveillance concept.

**10.1093_socpro_spaa022** - Doubled-Up Households
> Reviews housing/family literature efficiently, identifies that relational dynamics (host/guest) are understudied, moves quickly to identity/motherhood framing without extensive theoretical apparatus.

**10.1093_socpro_spz005** - Activity Spaces in Reentry
> Descriptive review of neighborhood effects and reentry literature, introduces activity spaces concept relatively late, minimal subsectioning, empirical focus.

## Why This Cluster Works

Gap-Filling is the **most common and safest** approach. It works because:
1. Readers quickly understand your contribution
2. Structure is predictable and easy to follow
3. Focus on empirical contribution keeps theoretical stakes manageable
4. Works for studies where the main value is "we didn't know this about this group"

If you're unsure which cluster fits, Gap-Filler is the default. But make sure your gap is **specific**.
