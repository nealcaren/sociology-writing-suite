# Cluster 5: Problem-Driven Pragmatist

**Prevalence**: 16.3% of articles

## When to Use This Cluster

Use the Problem-Driven approach when:
- You're **adjudicating a scholarly debate** between competing explanations
- Your contribution is primarily **empirical documentation** of an understudied phenomenon
- The research is **policy-relevant** and you're prioritizing applied value over theoretical elaboration
- You're organized around a **puzzle or historical development** rather than a theoretical framework

**Best for**: Resolving debates (does X help or harm Y?), documenting understudied policy contexts, historical-processual accounts.

## Distinguishing Features

| Feature | Problem-Driven Pattern |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Positioning Move** | Debate-resolution OR Empirical-elaboration |
| **Arc** | Problem-Response, Dialogue, or Narrative-Historical |
| **Subsections** | Variable (0-3) |
| **Literature Balance** | Balanced or substantive-heavy (85% not theory-heavy) |
| **Visual Elements** | Rare |
| **Turn Placement** | Variable (sometimes early or late) |
| **Hedging Level** | Moderate-high; hedged about competing explanations |

## Two Sub-Types

### Sub-type 5a: Debate-Resolvers
Frame existing literature as characterized by competing positions, then position your study as providing evidence to adjudicate.

### Sub-type 5b: Empirical Documenters
Heavy on policy or empirical context, light theoretical framing. The contribution is descriptive insight about an understudied phenomenon.

---

## Sub-type 5a: Debate-Resolver

### Characteristic Paragraph Sequence

1. **DESCRIBE_THEORY** - Present position 1 in the debate
2. **CONTRAST** - Present position 2
3. **CRITIQUE** - Show both are limited / tension unresolved
4. **STATE_QUESTIONS** - Position your study as adjudicating

### Signature Sentence Patterns

**Framing the Debate**:
> "Scholars disagree about whether [X] [helps/harms] [Y]..."
> "The effects of [X] are debated. Some scholars argue... Others contend..."
> "Two competing perspectives inform our understanding of [topic]..."

**Presenting Position 1**:
> "One line of research suggests that [X leads to Y]..."
> "According to [tradition/scholars], [claim]..."

**Introducing the Contrast**:
> "Others, however, argue that [alternative claim]..."
> "A contrasting account suggests..."
> "In contrast, scholars in [tradition] find..."

**Positioning Your Study**:
> "This study provides evidence to adjudicate this debate by..."
> "We ask whether [phenomenon] aligns more with [Position 1] or [Position 2]..."
> "This article examines [case] to shed light on this tension..."

### Hedging Calibration (5a)

| Claim Type | Hedging Level |
|------------|---------------|
| Describing Position 1 | Neutral reporting ("argue," "suggest") |
| Describing Position 2 | Neutral reporting (even-handed) |
| Your adjudication claim | **Moderate** ("provides evidence," "sheds light") |
| Predictions | Higher hedging |

Debate-Resolvers must be **even-handed** in presenting both sides. Don't tip your hand before the turn.

## Sub-type 5b: Empirical Documenter

### Characteristic Paragraph Sequence

1. **PROVIDE_CONTEXT** - Establish the phenomenon (extensive)
2. **PROVIDE_CONTEXT** - Additional contextual detail
3. **SYNTHESIZE** - Review prior research (often policy-focused)
4. **IDENTIFY_GAP** - What we don't yet know

### Signature Sentence Patterns

**Heavy Context Opening**:
> "The [policy/phenomenon] has [expanded/changed/emerged] in recent decades..."
> "In [year], [event/policy] transformed..."
> "As [social condition] has intensified..."

**Policy-Focused Synthesis**:
> "Research has documented [outcomes/patterns]..."
> "Studies find that [policy] affects [population] by..."

**Gap as Descriptive Need**:
> "Yet we know little about [specific aspect of phenomenon]..."
> "What remains unclear is how [actors] experience [policy/phenomenon]..."

### Hedging Calibration (5b)

| Claim Type | Hedging Level |
|------------|---------------|
| Contextual claims | Low (factual reporting) |
| Prior research findings | Moderate |
| Gap claim | Moderate-assertive |
| Theoretical claims | Higher hedging (light theoretical framing) |

Empirical Documenters have **less theoretical apparatus** to be confident about.

## Calibration Benchmarks (Cluster-Specific)

Based on Problem-Driven articles in the sample:

| Metric | Typical Range |
|--------|---------------|
| **Word count** | 1,000-1,600 (variable) |
| **Paragraphs** | 6-12 |
| **Subsections** | 0-3 |
| **Citations** | 20-40 |
| **Literature balance** | 15% theory-heavy, 46% balanced, 38% substantive-heavy |

Problem-Driven articles are **the most substantively-weighted**. More empirical/policy citations, fewer theoretical citations.

## Arc Options

### Problem-Response Arc
- Open with the puzzle/problem
- Present existing explanations
- Show limitations
- Preview your study's response

### Dialogue Arc (for Debate-Resolvers)
- Alternate between perspectives
- Let them "speak" to each other
- Position your study as resolving the conversation

### Narrative-Historical Arc
- Organize chronologically around a development
- Show how literature has evolved
- Position your study in the current moment

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| One-sided debate presentation | Present both sides fairly and at similar length |
| Overclaiming resolution | Your study "provides evidence," doesn't definitively settle |
| Context bloat | Keep empirical context focused; this isn't a policy report |
| Missing theoretical framing entirely | Even Empirical Documenters need some analytical lens |
| Turn lost in context | Make the gap/contribution explicit, even if theoretically light |

## Exemplar Articles

**10.1093_sf_soab152** - Immigrant Youth in Secondary Labor Market (Debate)
> Opens with debate over whether secondary labor market entry helps or harms migrant incorporation. Two camps clearly identified. Study positioned as providing evidence to adjudicate.

**10.1093_socpro_spab021** - Landlords and Poverty Governance (Empirical)
> Heavy on policy context about housing, eviction, landlord practices. Theoretical framing is light; contribution is primarily empirical documentation.

**10.1093_sf_soz110** - Nashville Civil Rights Movement (Historical-Narrative)
> Organized chronologically around movement development. Hypotheses derived from historical patterns. Less theory-driven than pathways-derived.

## Why This Cluster Works

Problem-Driven approaches serve different scholarly purposes:

**Debate-Resolution**:
1. Moves the field forward by providing empirical traction on contested questions
2. Shows you've mastered both sides of a literature
3. Readers know exactly what's at stake

**Empirical Documentation**:
1. Provides needed description of understudied contexts
2. Valuable for policy-relevant research
3. Lower theoretical risk; contribution is clearly empirical

The **key distinction** from Gap-Filler: Gap-Fillers ask "what do we not know about X?" Problem-Driven (Debate) asks "which explanation of X is right?" Problem-Driven (Empirical) prioritizes contextual description over theoretical framing.

**When in doubt**: If your "debate" is really one established view and your extension, you're probably Theory-Extender. If your empirical focus has a clear gap, you're probably Gap-Filler. Problem-Driven is for genuine tensions between positions or heavy contextual documentation.
