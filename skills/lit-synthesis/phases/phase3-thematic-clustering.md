# Phase 3: Thematic Clustering

## Why This Phase Matters

While theoretical mapping shows intellectual traditions, thematic clustering organizes papers by what they *study* and *how*. This reveals the empirical landscape: which populations have been studied, which settings, which methods dominate, and where there are gaps.

This clustering directly informs argument-builder's synthesis paragraphs and helps identify empirical gaps for contribution.

## Your Tasks

### 1. Cluster by Empirical Focus

Group papers by what they study:

**By Population**:
- Which groups are studied? (immigrants, mothers, youth, workers, etc.)
- Which populations are over/under-represented?

**By Setting**:
- What contexts? (neighborhoods, organizations, institutions, etc.)
- What geographic scope? (US-only? Comparative?)

**By Phenomenon**:
- What process or outcome? (decision-making, identity formation, mobility, etc.)
- What level of analysis? (individual, organizational, structural)

Create clusters:
```markdown
## Empirical Clusters

### By Population
- **Working-class mothers**: [Papers A, B, C]
- **Undocumented immigrants**: [Papers D, E]
- **Urban youth**: [Papers F, G, H]

### By Setting
- **Public housing**: [Papers A, D, F]
- **Courtrooms**: [Papers B, E]
- **Schools**: [Papers C, G, H]

### By Phenomenon
- **Police encounters**: [Papers A, B]
- **Housing instability**: [Papers C, D]
- **Identity work**: [Papers E, F, G]
```

### 2. Cluster by Methodological Approach

Group papers by how they study:

**Data Type**:
- In-depth interviews
- Ethnography
- Mixed methods
- Secondary data

**Analytic Approach**:
- Grounded theory
- Extended case method
- Comparative
- Process tracing

**Sample Characteristics**:
- Size (small N vs. larger)
- Recruitment (convenience vs. purposive vs. representative)
- Geographic scope

### 3. Cluster by Theoretical Approach

Complementing Phase 2, group by how theory is used:

**Theory as Lens**:
- Papers that apply an existing framework (Theory-Extender style)

**Theory as Contribution**:
- Papers that build new concepts (Concept-Builder style)

**Theory as Background**:
- Papers with light theoretical framing (Gap-Filler style)

### 4. Identify Cross-Cluster Papers

Some papers appear in multiple clusters:
- Bridges populations (studies both X and Y)
- Bridges settings (compares context A and B)
- Uses multiple methods

Note these—they often provide models for integrative work.

### 5. Identify Cluster Gaps

For each clustering dimension, note:
- **Over-represented**: What's been studied extensively?
- **Under-represented**: What's missing or sparse?
- **Strategic gaps**: Where could your project contribute?

### 6. Write Thematic Clusters Document

Create `thematic-clusters.md`:

```markdown
# Thematic Clusters

## Overview

Papers organized by empirical focus, method, and theoretical approach.

---

## By Population

### Cluster: [Population 1]
**Papers**: [N]
- [Author 2020]: [brief description]
- [Author 2019]: [brief description]

**What We Know**: [Summary of findings about this population]

**What's Missing**: [Gaps in studying this population]

### Cluster: [Population 2]
[Repeat structure]

---

## By Setting

### Cluster: [Setting 1]
**Papers**: [N]
- [List with brief descriptions]

**Dominant Findings**: [What do these papers collectively show?]

### Cluster: [Setting 2]
[Repeat]

---

## By Phenomenon

### Cluster: [Phenomenon 1]
**Papers**: [N]
- [List]

**Consensus**: [What most papers agree on]
**Variation**: [Where findings differ]

---

## By Method

| Method | Papers | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| In-depth interviews | [List] | [Typical N, approach] |
| Ethnography | [List] | [Duration, sites] |
| Mixed methods | [List] | [What mix] |

---

## Cross-Cluster Papers

| Paper | Clusters Bridged | Significance |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| [Author 2020] | [Pop A + Setting B] | [Why this matters] |

---

## Gap Analysis

### Over-Represented
- [Population/setting/phenomenon with extensive coverage]

### Under-Represented
- [Population/setting/phenomenon with sparse coverage]

### Strategic Gaps for This Project
1. **[Gap 1]**: [Description] — Papers touch on this but don't fully address
2. **[Gap 2]**: [Description] — No papers in corpus address this

---

## Implications for Writing

Based on these clusters:
- **Your project's empirical niche**: [Where it fits]
- **Papers to engage closely**: [Which clusters are most relevant]
- **Gap to highlight in turn**: [What's missing that you address]
```

## Guiding Principles

### Clusters Should Be Meaningful
Don't create clusters just to categorize. Each cluster should tell you something about the field.

### Look for Absences
Sometimes what's NOT in a cluster is more interesting than what's there.

### Cross-Cluster Papers Are Valuable
Papers that bridge categories often provide models for your own integrative work.

### Clusters Become Synthesis Paragraphs
In argument-builder, each cluster could become a paragraph or subsection. Think about writing as you cluster.

### Multiple Clustering Schemes Are OK
The same paper legitimately belongs in multiple clusters. That's information, not a problem.

## Output Files to Create

1. **thematic-clusters.md** - Full clustering analysis

## When You're Done

Report to the orchestrator:
- Number of clusters per dimension
- Key over/under-represented areas
- Papers that bridge clusters
- Strategic gaps identified

Example summary:
> "Thematic clustering complete. **By population**: 4 clusters (working-class mothers, immigrants, youth, homeowners). **By setting**: 3 clusters (neighborhoods, courtrooms, schools). Notable gap: no papers study *renters specifically* despite housing focus. Cross-cluster paper: Desmond 2016 bridges neighborhoods + housing instability. Recommend highlighting renter gap in argument-builder turn. Ready for Phase 4."
