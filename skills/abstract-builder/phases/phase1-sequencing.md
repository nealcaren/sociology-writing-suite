# Phase 1: Sequencing

## Why This Phase Matters

Abstracts follow a predictable move sequence. Before drafting prose, you need to know: What moves will you include? In what order? Where does each sentence fit? This phase ensures structural clarity before sentence-level writing begins.

## Your Tasks

### 1. Review Archetype Move Sequence

Each archetype has a characteristic sequence. Retrieve from the profile:

| Archetype | Typical Sequence |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Empirical-Showcase** | OPEN-PHENOMENON -> STUDY-FOCUS -> DATA-DESCRIBE -> FINDINGS -> FINDINGS -> CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION |
| **Research-Report** | PRIOR-RESEARCH -> GAP -> STUDY-FOCUS -> DATA-DESCRIBE -> FINDINGS -> CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION |
| **Stakes-Driven** | OPEN-STAKES -> GAP -> STUDY-FOCUS -> DATA-DESCRIBE -> FINDINGS -> FINDINGS -> CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION/IMPLICATIONS |
| **Puzzle-Solver** | OPEN-PUZZLE -> DATA-DESCRIBE -> STUDY-FOCUS -> FINDINGS -> FINDINGS -> CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION |

### 2. Plan Opening Move (Sentence 1)

The opening move must match the archetype:

| Archetype | Opening Move | Function |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Empirical-Showcase | OPEN-PHENOMENON | Describe observable social phenomenon |
| Research-Report | PRIOR-RESEARCH or OPEN-RESEARCH | Position in literature or state study directly |
| Stakes-Driven | OPEN-STAKES | Establish importance/urgency/change |
| Puzzle-Solver | OPEN-PUZZLE | Pose explicit question |

**Draft a topic sentence for the opening** based on the user's project.

### 3. Plan Middle Moves (Sentences 2-5)

The middle typically includes:

**STUDY-FOCUS** (90% of abstracts):
- What this study examines/explores/investigates
- Usually appears in position 2-3

**DATA-DESCRIBE** (87% of abstracts):
- Interview sample description
- Number, population, location
- Usually appears in position 3-4

**FINDINGS** (95% of abstracts, 2-3 sentences):
- Preview of key results
- Typically 2-4 sentences
- Usually positions 4-6

**Optional moves**:
- GAP (appears in ~40%): Limitation in existing knowledge
- PRIOR-RESEARCH (if not opener): Brief literature positioning
- ARGUMENT (rare): Interpretive claim

### 4. Plan Closing Move (Final Sentence)

Determine closing strategy:

| Closing Type | Frequency | Function | Verbs |
|--------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION | 73% | State what study demonstrates/shows | argue, demonstrate, show, reveal |
| CLOSE-IMPLICATIONS | 17% | State broader implications | have implications for, suggest |
| CLOSE-FINDINGS | 10% | End with final finding | find, reveal, show |

**Recommendation**: Use CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION unless you have strong policy implications (then CLOSE-IMPLICATIONS) or a tight word count (then CLOSE-FINDINGS).

### 5. Map Complete Sequence

Create a sentence-by-sentence plan:

```markdown
## Move Sequence Plan

**Archetype**: [Name]
**Target**: [N] sentences, ~[X] words

### Sentence Map

| Position | Move | Content Preview | Target Words |
|----------|------|-----------------|--------------|
| S1 | [MOVE] | [brief description] | ~30 |
| S2 | [MOVE] | [brief description] | ~30 |
| S3 | [MOVE] | [brief description] | ~30 |
| S4 | [MOVE] | [brief description] | ~30 |
| S5 | [MOVE] | [brief description] | ~30 |
| S6 | [MOVE] | [brief description] | ~30 |

**Total target**: ~180 words
```

### 6. Identify Key Transitions

Plan the connections between moves:

**OPEN to STUDY-FOCUS**:
- "This study examines..."
- "This article explores..."
- "In this paper, we..."

**DATA-DESCRIBE to FINDINGS**:
- "Findings show that..."
- "We find that..."
- "I find that..."

**FINDINGS to CLOSE**:
- "This research demonstrates..."
- "These findings suggest..."
- "Taken together..."

### 7. Write Sequencing Memo

Create the sequencing memo:

```markdown
# Move Sequence Plan

## Archetype: [Name]

## Sentence Sequence

### S1: [MOVE TYPE]
**Function**: [what this sentence does]
**Content**: [draft topic/content]
**Target**: ~30 words

### S2: [MOVE TYPE]
**Function**: [what this sentence does]
**Content**: [draft topic/content]
**Target**: ~30 words

[Continue for all sentences...]

## Transition Plan

- S1 to S2: [transition phrase]
- S2 to S3: [transition phrase]
- [Continue...]

## Calibration Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Sentence count | [N] |
| Word count | [range] |
| Findings sentences | [N] |
| Closing type | [type] |

## Notes for Drafting

[Any special considerations, challenges, or decisions]
```

## Guiding Principles

### Follow the Archetype Pattern
The sequences exist because they work. Deviate only with good reason.

### Don't Skip Essential Moves
STUDY-FOCUS, DATA-DESCRIBE, and FINDINGS are essential. Skipping them leaves readers confused.

### Findings Get the Most Space
Plan for 2-3 findings sentences. This is what readers remember.

### The Closing Matters
Don't let the abstract trail off. Plan a strong closing sentence.

### Word Budget is Tight
With ~180 words across 6 sentences, each sentence is ~30 words. Plan accordingly.

## Archetype-Specific Guidance

### Empirical-Showcase (6-7 sentences)
- S1 must describe phenomenon, not cite literature
- Move quickly from phenomenon to study focus
- Extended findings (2-4 sentences)
- Strong contribution closing

### Research-Report (6 sentences)
- Can open with literature OR direct research statement
- GAP is common in position 2
- Efficient structure—no wasted words
- Contribution closing extends understanding

### Stakes-Driven (7 sentences)
- S1 establishes importance/urgency
- Often includes GAP in position 2
- May close with implications instead of contribution
- Longest archetype

### Puzzle-Solver (6 sentences)
- S1 is explicit question
- Move quickly from question to data
- Findings answer the question
- Closing illuminates contribution

## When You're Done

Report to the orchestrator:
- Sentence count planned
- Move sequence confirmed
- Opening move drafted
- Closing move strategy selected
- Word count target
- Any concerns about fit

Example summary:
> "**Sequence complete**. Planning **6-sentence Empirical-Showcase** structure: PHENOMENON -> STUDY-FOCUS -> DATA-DESCRIBE -> FINDINGS -> FINDINGS -> CONTRIBUTION. Opening: phenomenonof doubled-up households. Closing: contribution claim about identity negotiation. Target: ~185 words. Ready for Phase 2: Drafting."
