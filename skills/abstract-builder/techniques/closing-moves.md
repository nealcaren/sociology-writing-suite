# Closing Moves

A vocabulary of closing sentence types for abstract writing, based on analysis of 91 abstracts from *Social Problems* and *Social Forces*.

---

## Overview

The closing sentence is your last chance to tell readers what to take away. It should state your contribution explicitly, not trail off with a final finding.

| Closing Move | Frequency | Function | Strong Verbs |
|--------------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION | 72.5% | State what study demonstrates | argue, demonstrate, show, reveal |
| CLOSE-IMPLICATIONS | 16.5% | State broader implications | suggest, have implications for |
| CLOSE-FINDINGS | 9.9% | End with final finding | find, reveal, show |
| CLOSE-GENERALIZATION | 1.1% | Broader claim | illustrate, highlight |

## 1. CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION (72.5%)

State what the study demonstrates, shows, or argues.

### When to Use
- You want to make an explicit contribution claim
- Your findings support a clear argument
- You're extending understanding of a topic
- **Default choice for most abstracts**

### Template Patterns

**Pattern A: This [research/study/work] demonstrates...**
> "This [research/work/study] demonstrates [contribution]."

**Pattern B: These findings suggest that...**
> "These findings suggest that [broader implication of results]."

**Pattern C: [We/I] argue that...**
> "[We/I] argue that [contribution to understanding]."

**Pattern D: This article shows...**
> "This article shows [what we now know]."

**Pattern E: This research extends...**
> "This research [extends/advances] our understanding of [topic]."

**Pattern F: In so doing, [study] contributes to...**
> "In so doing, [the article/this study] contributes to [theories/understanding]."

### Common Contribution Verbs

| Verb | Usage | Strength |
|------|-------|----------|
| **argue** | Interpretive claim | Strong assertion |
| **demonstrate** | Evidence-based claim | Strong assertion |
| **show** | Reveal findings | Moderate assertion |
| **reveal** | Uncover findings | Moderate assertion |
| **suggest** | Tentative claim | Hedged |
| **extend** | Build on existing work | Positioning |
| **advance** | Move field forward | Positioning |
| **contribute** | Add to field | Positioning |
| **illuminate** | Clarify understanding | Insight-oriented |

### Examples from Corpus

> "These findings suggest that nationally specific understandings of merit can have quite different implications for the legitimation of inequality."

> "Our research demonstrates that clinicians and hospitals are harming patients, often through the normal application of established hospital protocols and behaviors, when women do not feel involved in decisions about their care."

> "This work demonstrates the ways in which undocumented immigrants engage in selective status disclosure as one of myriad strategies to mitigate the harmful affective and material effects of undocumented immigration status."

> "This article shows how the durability of individualist perspectives contributes to persistent gender inequality by privileging individualized solutions over more effective structural ones."

> "This research extends our understanding of the reach of surveillance into the lives of the poor even in spaces considered to be private."

> "In so doing, the article contributes to theories of transnationalism, social movements, diaspora politics, and cross-border contentious politics more generally."

> "This research advances our understanding of immigrant youth's lives by examining how institutional context, familial obligations across borders, and limited ethnic networks play a role in shaping the incorporation experiences of unaccompanied, undocumented Latinx immigrants as they come of age in the United States."

## 2. CLOSE-IMPLICATIONS (16.5%)

State the broader implications of findings, often for policy or practice.

### When to Use
- Your research has clear policy implications
- You want to emphasize practical significance
- Stakes-Driven archetype (42% use this closing)
- Timeliness or urgency is part of your framing

### Template Patterns

**Pattern A: Our findings have implications for...**
> "Our findings have implications for [broader understanding/policy area]."

**Pattern B: As [trend] continues...**
> "As [trend] continues, [implications]."

**Pattern C: [Closing insight with implications]**
> "[Substantive closing that highlights practical/policy implications]."

### Examples from Corpus

> "As labor market precarity continues to spread within expert and professional fields, our findings have implications for broader sociological understandings of professional education."

> "As reporting systems serve as vital sources of support for disadvantaged families, mothers' practices of information management, while perhaps protecting them from CPS reports, may preclude opportunities for assistance and reinforce a sense of constraint in families' institutional interactions."

> "Our findings reveal the role of plans in the residential decision-making of middle-class households and have implications for understanding post-disaster immobility at a time when middle-class households are increasingly exposed to environmental disasters."

## 3. CLOSE-FINDINGS (9.9%)

End with a final finding rather than explicit contribution claim.

### When to Use
- Word count is very tight
- Final finding is particularly striking
- Contribution is implicit in the findings
- Puzzle-Solver archetype (40% use this)

### Template Patterns

**Pattern A: [We/I] find that...**
> "[We/I] find that [final finding]."

**Pattern B: [Final finding as statement]**
> "[Declarative statement of key finding]."

### Examples from Corpus

> "The households that stayed had long-term plans to remain in their homes before the flood, while the small number who decided to move generally had well-defined plans to do so in the near future before the storm hit."

**Note**: CLOSE-FINDINGS is less common because it misses the opportunity to make an explicit contribution claim. Use sparingly.

## 4. CLOSE-GENERALIZATION (1.1%)

Make a broader claim about patterns or processes.

### When to Use
- Rare—only when your contribution is a generalizable insight
- The finding itself is the contribution

### Template Pattern

> "[Broad statement that generalizes from findings]."

**Note**: This is the rarest closing type. Most abstracts benefit from explicit contribution claims.

## Verb Selection Guide

### High-Confidence Claims
Use when findings strongly support the claim:
- **demonstrate**: "This research demonstrates that..."
- **show**: "This article shows..."
- **reveal**: "Our analysis reveals..."

### Interpretive Claims
Use when making an argument beyond findings:
- **argue**: "We argue that..."
- **contend**: "This study contends..."

### Positioning Claims
Use when emphasizing contribution to field:
- **extend**: "This research extends our understanding..."
- **advance**: "This work advances..."
- **contribute**: "This study contributes to..."

### Hedged Claims
Use when suggesting implications:
- **suggest**: "These findings suggest..."
- **illuminate**: "Our analysis illuminates..."
- **indicate**: "These results indicate..."

## Strong vs. Weak Closings

### Weak Closings (Avoid)

| Problem | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Vague** | "This contributes to our understanding." | Specify what understanding |
| **Passive** | "Implications are discussed." | Use active voice |
| **Trailing off** | "More research is needed." | State contribution instead |
| **No claim** | Ends with finding only | Add contribution statement |
| **Generic** | "This matters for sociology." | Be specific |

### Strong Closings (Model)

| Strength | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Specific contribution** | "This research demonstrates that clinicians and hospitals are harming patients through the normal application of established protocols when women do not feel involved in decisions." |
| **Field positioning** | "This research extends our understanding of surveillance into spaces considered private." |
| **Clear implication** | "As labor market precarity continues to spread, our findings have implications for broader understandings of professional education." |
| **Theoretical advance** | "In so doing, the article contributes to theories of transnationalism, social movements, and diaspora politics." |

## Archetype-Specific Guidance

| Archetype | Recommended Closing | Notes |
|-----------|--------------------|----- |
| **Empirical-Showcase** | CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION (83%) | Use demonstrate, show, reveal |
| **Research-Report** | CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION (78%) | Use extend, advance, contribute |
| **Stakes-Driven** | Split: CONTRIBUTION (58%) / IMPLICATIONS (42%) | Consider policy implications |
| **Puzzle-Solver** | Split: CONTRIBUTION (60%) / FINDINGS (40%) | Illuminate or reveal |

---

## Quick Reference

### Default Choice
Use CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION with strong verb (demonstrate, show, argue).

### For Policy-Relevant Topics
Consider CLOSE-IMPLICATIONS ("Our findings have implications for...").

### For Tight Word Counts
CLOSE-FINDINGS acceptable but misses contribution claim opportunity.

### Always Avoid
- Vague contribution statements
- Passive constructions
- Trailing off without emphasis
- "More research is needed" endings
