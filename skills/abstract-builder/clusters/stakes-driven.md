# Archetype 3: Stakes-Driven

**Prevalence**: 12 abstracts (13.2% of corpus)

## Overview

**Definition**: Abstracts that open by establishing why the topic matters (importance, urgency, change, disruption), then justify research significance before reporting findings.

**Strategic Purpose**: Justify research by foregrounding significance. Appeals to readers who need to know "why this matters" before engaging. Often addresses policy-relevant topics.

## When to Use This Archetype

Use Stakes-Driven when:
- You need to justify why your topic is important
- Your research addresses policy-relevant issues
- Social change, disruption, or trends are central to your framing
- You want to emphasize practical implications
- Readers need to know "why this matters" before engaging

**Best for**: Policy-relevant topics, when significance isn't obvious, when you want implications-focused closing, slightly longer abstracts.

## Move Sequence Pattern

**Typical 7-sentence sequence**:
```
S1: OPEN-STAKES
S2: GAP (or STUDY-FOCUS)
S3: STUDY-FOCUS (or DATA-DESCRIBE)
S4: DATA-DESCRIBE
S5: FINDINGS
S6: FINDINGS
S7: CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION or CLOSE-IMPLICATIONS
```

## Opening Sentence Patterns

### Pattern A: [Trend/change] is [disrupting/affecting]...

> "Women increasingly work for pay, disrupting cultural expectations and relational dynamics tied to men's breadwinning."

> "Many professional labor markets are currently experiencing signs of deprofessionalization, including automation of tasks and increasingly unstable employment conditions."

### Pattern B: [Topic] is/are [important/critical/central]

> "Neighborhoods are an important social context for children's development; however, a growing body of research illustrates that there is often significant heterogeneity..."

> "Private landlords play an important role in America's poverty governance, with profound effects on poor families and neighborhoods."

### Pattern C: With [trend/expansion]...

> "With the expansion of state surveillance and enforcement efforts in recent decades, a growing literature examines how those vulnerable to punitive state contact strategize to evade it."

### Pattern D: [Group/phenomenon] represents [significance]

> "Ghostwriters represent a form of labor aimed at producing someone else's self, or what we label 'stand-in labor.' This growing workforce sits at the intersection of critical developments in today's neoliberal economy..."

## Closing Sentence Patterns

### Pattern A: Implications-focused (42% of Stakes-Driven)

> "As labor market precarity continues to spread within expert and professional fields, our findings have implications for broader sociological understandings of professional education."

> "As reporting systems serve as vital sources of support for disadvantaged families, mothers' practices of information management, while perhaps protecting them from CPS reports, may preclude opportunities for assistance and reinforce a sense of constraint in families' institutional interactions."

### Pattern B: Framework contribution (58%)

> "This study offers a framework to understand shifting gender relations during periods of economic change."

## Transition Phrases

## Checklist

Before finalizing a Stakes-Driven abstract, verify:

- [ ] Opening sentence establishes importance/urgency/change (not phenomenon)
- [ ] Stakes are genuine (not throat-clearing)
- [ ] Gap appears early (position 2-3 typically)
- [ ] Data description includes N, population, location
- [ ] Findings connect to established stakes
- [ ] Closing uses implications OR contribution framing
- [ ] Total: 5-10 sentences, 155-248 words
- [ ] Policy/practical relevance is clear

## Stakes vs. Phenomenon

A common confusion is distinguishing Stakes-Driven from Empirical-Showcase:

| Stakes-Driven | Empirical-Showcase |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Explains why it MATTERS | Describes what IS happening |
| "Women increasingly work for pay, disrupting..." | "Elites often use merit to explain..." |
| Justifies significance | Grounds in social world |
| Often includes "important," "critical," trends | Describes observable patterns |

**Test**: Does your opening explain why we should care, or describe what's happening? If the former, Stakes-Driven. If the latter, Empirical-Showcase.

## Why This Archetype Works

Stakes-Driven is effective when:
1. **Significance isn't obvious**: The opening does the work of justification
2. **Policy relevance**: Readers who care about implications engage immediately
3. **Timeliness**: Trend-based framing creates urgency
4. **Implications payoff**: The closing delivers on the promised significance

**Caution**: Don't use Stakes-Driven if your stakes feel generic. "This topic is important because..." without genuine urgency falls flat.
