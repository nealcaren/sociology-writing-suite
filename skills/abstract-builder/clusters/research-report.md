# Archetype 2: Research-Report

**Prevalence**: 39 abstracts (42.9% of corpus, most common)

## Overview

**Definition**: Abstracts that open by positioning within scholarly conversation (literature, prior research, or direct research statement), then report study findings efficiently.

**Strategic Purpose**: Maximize clarity and efficiency for specialist readers. Position contribution within existing literature. Prioritize content over framing.

**Note**: This archetype includes the former "Gap-Filler" variant, which opens with a gap statement.

## When to Use This Archetype

Use Research-Report when:
- Your audience is specialists in your subfield
- You want to position your study within a scholarly conversation
- You have a clear gap in existing literature to address
- Efficiency and directness are valued
- Your contribution is primarily to existing debates

**Best for**: Specialist audiences, gap-filling contributions, when positioning matters more than phenomenon description.

## Checklist

Before finalizing a Research-Report abstract, verify:

- [ ] Opening sentence positions in literature OR states study directly
- [ ] Gap is specific (not "more research is needed")
- [ ] Study focus is clear
- [ ] Data description includes N, population, location
- [ ] Findings are concrete and specific
- [ ] Closing extends understanding or contributes to field
- [ ] Total: 4-10 sentences, 116-250 words
- [ ] Efficient structure—no wasted words

## Why This Archetype Works

Research-Report is the most common archetype because:
1. **Clear positioning**: Readers immediately know the scholarly conversation
2. **Efficiency**: Gets to the point without extensive framing
3. **Professional**: Matches reader expectations for specialist journals
4. **Flexible**: Works with literature-led, research-led, or gap-led variants

**Default choice**: When in doubt, use Research-Report. It's safe, professional, and widely accepted.
