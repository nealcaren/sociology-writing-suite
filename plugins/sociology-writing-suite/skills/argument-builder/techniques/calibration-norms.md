## Target Ranges

Use the interquartile range (Q25-Q75) as your target. Deviations should be intentional.

### Length
- **Target word count**: 1,145-1,744 words
- **Target paragraphs**: 7-12 paragraphs
- **Under 1,000 words**: May signal insufficient theoretical development
- **Over 2,000 words**: May signal over-elaboration (unless Concept-Builder)

### Citation Density
- **Target citations per paragraph**: 2.4-5.0
- **Target citations per 1,000 words**: 19-32
- **Under 2 per paragraph**: May signal insufficient engagement
- **Over 6 per paragraph**: May signal listing rather than synthesizing

### Structure
- **Target subsections**: 1-3
- **0 subsections**: Acceptable for streamlined Gap-Fillers
- **4+ subsections**: Appropriate for Concept-Builders, may signal over-structuring otherwise

### Paragraph Length
- **Target words per paragraph**: 129-165
- **Under 100 words**: May be underdeveloped
- **Over 200 words**: Consider splitting

## Cluster-Specific Norms

### Cluster 1: Gap-Filler Minimalist (27.5%)

| Metric | Typical Range |
|--------|---------------|
| Word count | 1,000-1,400 |
| Paragraphs | 6-10 |
| Subsections | 0-2 |
| Citations | 25-35 |
| Literature balance | 59% balanced, 23% substantive-heavy |

**Key**: Leaner than average. Efficient synthesis, sharp turn.

---

### Cluster 2: Theory-Extension (22.5%)

| Metric | Typical Range |
|--------|---------------|
| Word count | 1,300-1,800 |
| Paragraphs | 8-12 |
| Subsections | 1-4 |
| Citations | 30-45 |
| Literature balance | 78% theory-heavy |

**Key**: Moderate length. Higher citation density in framework exposition.

---

### Cluster 3: Concept-Builder (15.0%)

| Metric | Typical Range |
|--------|---------------|
| Word count | 1,600-2,500+ |
| Paragraphs | 12-20+ |
| Subsections | 3-5+ |
| Citations | 40-70+ |
| Literature balance | 92% theory-heavy |

**Key**: Longest of all clusters. Space needed for conceptual apparatus.

---

### Cluster 4: Synthesis Integrator (18.8%)

| Metric | Typical Range |
|--------|---------------|
| Word count | 1,300-1,800 |
| Paragraphs | 10-14 |
| Subsections | 2-4 |
| Citations | 35-50 |
| Literature balance | 67% theory-heavy, 33% balanced |

**Key**: Middle ground. Citations drawn from multiple traditions.

---

### Cluster 5: Problem-Driven (16.3%)

| Metric | Typical Range |
|--------|---------------|
| Word count | 1,000-1,600 |
| Paragraphs | 6-12 |
| Subsections | 0-3 |
| Citations | 20-40 |
| Literature balance | 46% balanced, 38% substantive-heavy |

**Key**: Variable structure. More empirical/policy citations.

---

## Literature Balance Definitions

| Category | Definition | Typical For |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Theory-Heavy** | 2/3+ of paragraphs primarily theoretical | Concept-Builder, Theory-Extender |
| **Balanced** | Roughly equal theory and substantive | Gap-Filler, Synthesis |
| **Substantive-Heavy** | 2/3+ empirical/contextual | Problem-Driven (Empirical) |

### Balance by Cluster

| Cluster | Theory-Heavy | Balanced | Substantive-Heavy |
|---------|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| Gap-Filler | 18% | 59% | 23% |
| Theory-Extension | 78% | 22% | 0% |
| Concept-Builder | 92% | 8% | 0% |
| Synthesis | 67% | 33% | 0% |
| Problem-Driven | 15% | 46% | 38% |

---

## Subsection Interpretation

| Subsection Count | Signal |
|------------------|--------|
| **0** | Streamlined, empirically-focused |
| **1-2** | Organized literature review |
| **3-4** | Multiple theoretical components |
| **5+** | Building theoretical apparatus |

**Rule**: Match structure to ambition. Gap-Fillers with 5 subsections confuse readers.

---

## Visual Elements

Only 8.8% of articles include tables or figures in the Theory section.

| Has Visual | Cluster Association |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Table** | Concept-Builders presenting typologies/frameworks |
| **Figure** | Concept-Builders presenting process models |
| **None** | All other clusters (92%) |

**Guideline**: Only include a visual if you're introducing a new framework worth visualizing.

---

## Outlier Analysis

### Unusually Long (2,500+ words)
- Typically Concept-Builders
- Often have 5+ subsections
- Usually 60+ citations
- Justified when building substantial theoretical apparatus

### Unusually Short (Under 800 words)
- Rare in these journals
- May work for tightly focused empirical documenters
- Risk signaling insufficient theoretical engagement

### Citation Outliers (70+ citations)
- Strong correlation with Concept-Builder cluster
- Often involve synthesizing multiple literatures
- Requires space to justify

## Calibration Checklist

Before finalizing, verify your draft against these norms:

| Metric | Your Draft | Target (for cluster) | Status |
|--------|------------|---------------------|--------|
| Word count | ___ | ___ - ___ | [ ] OK / [ ] Adjust |
| Paragraphs | ___ | ___ - ___ | [ ] OK / [ ] Adjust |
| Subsections | ___ | ___ - ___ | [ ] OK / [ ] Adjust |
| Total citations | ___ | ___ - ___ | [ ] OK / [ ] Adjust |
| Citations/paragraph | ___ | 2.4 - 5.0 | [ ] OK / [ ] Adjust |
| Literature balance | ___ | ___ | [ ] OK / [ ] Adjust |

**If outside target range**: Intentional deviation is fine, but you should be able to justify why your section needs to be longer/shorter/more or less citation-dense than typical.

## Interpreting Deviations

| Deviation | Possible Reasons | Action |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| **Too short** | Insufficient synthesis; rushed turn | Expand literature engagement |
| **Too long** | Over-elaboration; catalog style | Cut redundancy; sharpen argument |
| **Under-cited** | Thin engagement; missed literature | Add sources; deepen synthesis |
| **Over-cited** | Listing not synthesizing | Aggregate findings; cut citation strings |
| **Too many subsections** | Over-structuring simple argument | Merge or eliminate |
| **Too few subsections** | Complex argument needs organization | Add structure for clarity |
