# Phase 0: Intake & Scope

You are executing Phase 0 of the interview write-up workflow. Your goal is to confirm required inputs, clarify scope, and plan the writing task.

## Why This Phase Matters

A strong write-up depends on clear claims, structured evidence, and transparent methods. Missing inputs create weak or generic prose.

## Required Inputs

Ask users to provide the following materials before drafting.

### If Coming from interview-analyst

If the user ran the **interview-analyst** skill first, request these outputs:

| From interview-analyst | Phase | What It Provides |
|------------------------|-------|------------------|
| **quote-database.md** | Phase 5 | Quotes organized by finding with luminous exemplars flagged, anchor/echo candidates identified, prevalence noted, full attribution |
| **participant-profiles/** | Phase 2 | Demographics, trajectories, extended quotes, punchy quotes, in-vivo terms for each participant |
| **core-argument.md** | Phase 5 | Research question, central argument, contribution |
| **paper-outline.md** | Phase 5 | Structural outline with findings |

These files are designed to feed directly into writeup. The quote-database.md is the primary handoff—it contains everything needed for the anchor-echo pattern.

### If Starting Fresh (no prior analysis)

| Document | What to Include | Why Needed |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Main argument** | 1–2 sentence statement of the core finding or claim | To recommend structure and maintain focus |
| **Participant table** | Pseudonyms, key demographics (age, race/ethnicity, gender, class, role), any characteristics relevant to analysis | For accurate, rich attribution in quotes |
| **Main findings** | 3–4 findings they want to present, with brief descriptions | To structure the findings section |
| **Selected quotes** | Key quotes organized by finding, with speaker identified | The evidence to work with |

**Note on quote format**: For each finding, you need:
- **1-2 extended quotes** (3-6 sentences) suitable for anchor vignettes—showing participant's voice, reasoning, internal logic
- **3-5 shorter quotes** (1-2 sentences) suitable for echoes—showing prevalence across participants
- **Full attribution** for each: name, race/ethnicity, gender, age, role/position, and any study-relevant characteristics

### Required for Methods Section

| Document | What to Include | Why Needed |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Methods notes** | N, dates, location, target population, sampling strategy, recruitment method, response rate (if known), interview format/duration, recording/transcription approach, analysis method | To draft accurate methods section |

### Highly Useful

| Document | What to Include | Why Needed |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Analytical memos** | Notes written during analysis explaining interpretations | To understand their reasoning |
| **Codebook** | List of codes with definitions | To understand analytical categories |
| **Draft outline or partial draft** | Current structure or existing text | To build on their work |
| **Variation/exceptions notes** | Cases that don't fit the main pattern | To address heterogeneity |

### Optional but Helpful

| Document | What to Include | Why Needed |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Target journal** | Journal name or sample article | To calibrate length and style |
| **Literature context** | Key theoretical frameworks or debates | To connect findings to field |
| **Full transcripts** | Complete interview transcripts | To find additional quotes or check context |

## Sample Formats

### Participant Table

```
| Pseudonym | Age | Race/Ethnicity | Gender | Occupation | Key Characteristic |
|-----------|-----|----------------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Helen | 63 | Black | Woman | Retired nurse | Cares for disabled son |
| Vanessa | 34 | Black | Woman | Marketing manager | Recent homebuyer |
| Marcus | 45 | White | Man | Attorney | Hired lawyer for negotiation |
```

### Quote Organization

```
## Finding 1: [Title]

**Claim**: [One sentence stating the finding]

**Quote 1** (Helen):
"[Quote text]"
Context: [When/why this was said]

**Quote 2** (Marcus):
"[Quote text]"
Context: [When/why this was said]

**Variation/Exception** (Vanessa):
"[Quote showing different pattern]"
Context: [Why this case differs]
```

## Clarify Scope

Ask:
- Are we working on **methods**, **findings**, or **both**?
- Is this **drafting from scratch** or **revising** existing text?
- What is the **target journal** or audience, if any?

## Output

Provide a short intake memo that includes:
- Missing inputs
- Agreed scope and deliverables
- Proposed findings structure (if enough info is available)

## When You’re Done

Return a summary to the orchestrator with:
1. Which inputs were provided
2. Missing inputs to request
3. Agreed scope (methods/findings/both)
4. Recommended structure approach if appropriate
