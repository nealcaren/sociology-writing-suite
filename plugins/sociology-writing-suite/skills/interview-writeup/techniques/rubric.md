# Writing Rubric: The 8-Step Process

You are writing the **results section of a qualitative, interview-based sociology article**. Your task is to *advance analytic claims* using interview data, not to summarize interviews.

---

## Step 1: Declare the Analytic Move (Internal)

Before writing a subsection, silently identify:

- The **core analytic claim** of this subsection
- The **mechanism or process** being demonstrated
- Whether this subsection establishes a **baseline pattern** or **variation**

Do not write until this is clear.

---

## Step 2: Open with an Analytic Assertion

Begin the subsection with **2-4 sentences** that:

- State the analytic pattern in generalized terms
- Use sociological language (not respondent language)
- Indicate scope ("most respondents," "across cases," "in both sites")
- Signal whether variation will follow

**Do not** mention specific individuals yet.

**Example**:
> "Participants across both sites expressed profound distrust of institutional recovery processes. This distrust did not emerge from ignorance of available resources but from repeated experiences of procedural unfairness—what we term 'bureaucratic betrayal.' The pattern held regardless of respondents' prior experience with government agencies, though it manifested differently across racial and class lines."

---

## Step 3: Elaborate the Mechanism

Add **1-2 sentences** explaining *how* or *why* this pattern operates.

Acceptable moves:
- Naming a process (e.g., boundary-drawing, legitimation, symbolic violence)
- Linking to structural conditions
- Clarifying what is at stake for respondents

**Do not** introduce quotes yet.

**Example**:
> "This distrust was actively produced through interactions that signaled to applicants that their claims were illegitimate and their time expendable. The cumulative effect was a learned helplessness that discouraged further engagement with recovery systems."

---

## Step 4: Introduce a Quote with Purpose

Introduce each quote by explaining **what it illustrates**.

Every quote introduction must:
- Name the analytic concept it exemplifies
- Explain why this quote is being shown *now*
- Avoid neutral attributions like "X said"

**Example lead-ins**:
- "As one participant described this process..."
- "This logic is evident in how..."
- "Illustrating this dynamic..."
- "The stakes of this pattern are clear in..."

**Example**:
> "The texture of bureaucratic betrayal is evident in Helen's account. Helen, a 63-year-old Black homeowner who had lived in the same house for three decades, spent nearly four years navigating FEMA's appeals process:"

---

## Step 5: Present the Quote

- Use **long quotes** when voice, narrative arc, or internal contradiction matters
- Quotes should *instantiate*, not introduce, ideas
- Quotes may include narrative detail, emotion, or metaphor
- Preserve verbal texture when it reveals cognition

**Do not** stack quotes back-to-back.

---

## Step 6: Interpret the Quote Explicitly

Immediately after each quote, write **at least one sentence** that:

- Names what the quote shows
- Links it back to the subsection's analytic claim
- Translates respondent language into sociological meaning

**Never assume the quote "speaks for itself."**

**Example**:
> "Helen's characterization of FEMA as 'neglectful'—and her framing of herself as fighting 'tooth and nail'—illustrates how procedural unfairness is experienced not merely as bureaucratic inconvenience but as active institutional hostility. Her case shows that applicants found the procedures to be fundamentally unfair, and that race, class, and gender shaped one's potential for securing recovery aid."

---

## Step 7: Show Prevalence (The Echo)

After the anchor vignette, demonstrate that this isn't idiosyncratic:

- Cite 2-3 other participants briefly
- Use shorter, punchier quotes
- Signal scope: "Other respondents echoed...", "This sentiment was shared..."

**Example**:
> "Other respondents echoed Helen's sense of institutional betrayal. Marcus, a retired white teacher, described feeling 'invisible' to case workers. Denise, a young mother of three, recounted being told her claim was 'not a priority' despite visible damage to her home. As she put it: 'They looked at me like I was trying to steal something.' Across racial and class lines, participants framed their interactions with recovery institutions as adversarial rather than supportive."

---

## Step 8: Manage Variation and Close

If introducing variation:
- Signal the shift explicitly ("However," "In contrast," "This pattern diverged when...")
- Describe the axis of difference (race, class, experience, context)
- Explain why the difference matters analytically

**Do not** treat variation as a list or exception dump.

Close the subsection with **1-2 sentences** that:
- Reaffirm the analytic contribution
- Connect to the next process, tension, or section
- Avoid summarizing quotes

**Example close**:
> "Bureaucratic betrayal thus operated as more than frustration with red tape; it actively eroded respondents' sense of citizenship and belonging. This erosion set the stage for the second mechanism we identified: the turn to informal, community-based support networks."

---

## Prohibited Moves

Do **not**:
- Start a subsection with a quote
- List themes without argument
- Use quotes as evidence without interpretation
- Stack quotes back-to-back without analytical mediation
- Hedge empirical patterns ("might suggest," "could indicate")
- Write purely descriptive subheadings ("Race," "Gender," "Findings")
- Use neutral attribution when analytic framing is possible
- Let quotes introduce analytic novelty

## Quality Self-Check

Before finishing each subsection, verify:

- [ ] The subsection advances one clear analytic claim
- [ ] The claim is stated before any quotes appear
- [ ] Every quote is framed (why showing it) and interpreted (what it shows)
- [ ] An anchor vignette goes deep on one case
- [ ] Echo quotes establish prevalence
- [ ] The author's voice outweighs participant voice overall
- [ ] The subsection reads as an argument, not a transcript
- [ ] Variation is introduced only after baseline is established
- [ ] The close connects forward to the next section
