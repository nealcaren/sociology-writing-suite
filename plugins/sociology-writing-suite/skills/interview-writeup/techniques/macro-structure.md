# Macro-Structure: Organizing the Findings Section

## The "Roadmap + Pillars" Model

Every findings section follows a standard architecture: **one introductory "Roadmap" paragraph followed by 3-4 thematic subsections ("Pillars")**, ending with a hard stop after the final pillar.

### The Roadmap Introduction

The Findings section does not "warm up." It begins with a high-density Roadmap (1-2 paragraphs, approximately 150-300 words) that summarizes the entire argument before presenting evidence. This functions as a "mini-abstract" for the results.

**Structure:**

1. **The Headline Sentence**: The first sentence states the primary finding as a fact, not a process.
   - Bad: "I interviewed 50 people about disaster recovery."
   - Good: "Exit from high-intensity movements operates through multiple distinct mechanisms that the catch-all of 'burnout' obscures."

2. **The Mechanism Summary**: 2-3 sentences explaining how the phenomenon works, briefly listing the key themes of the upcoming subsections.
   - Example: "We identify three pillars of the exit experience: (1) the mechanisms of exhaustion—disaggregated into pace depletion, grief accumulation, and fit failure; (2) the structures of opportunity that determined which exit pathways were available based on organizational position; and (3) the persistence of identity that rendered organizational departure something other than true exit."

3. **The Signpost**: A final sentence that transitions into the first subsection or defines the scope.
   - Example: "The analysis below demonstrates how these pillars operated in sequence and interaction—exhaustion creating the pressure to leave, position determining where one could go, and identity ensuring that leaving was never complete."

### The Hard Stop Ending

Unlike the Introduction, the Findings section has **no separate conclusion**. It simply stops after the final thematic subsection is complete. The actual "Conclusion" or "Discussion" of the paper is a separate section that follows later.

The final pillar should end with:
- **A "Clinching" Quote or Vignette**: The section often ends on a powerful, illustrative quote that encapsulates the final point.
- **A "Mic Drop" Sentence**: A final analytical sentence that restates the significance of that specific subsection.
  - Example: "What the literature calls 'exit' may be better understood as dispersal: the movement identity spreading out from the organization into the broader world, carried by individuals who remain, in some fundamental sense, what the movement made them."

Do **not** add a summary paragraph that recaps all the pillars. That work belongs in the Discussion section.

### The Pillars (Subsections)

**Quantity**: 3-4 subsections is the sweet spot.

**Headings must be theoretical, not descriptive**:

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "What Participants Said About Landmen" | "Corporate Landmen as Liaisons of Meta-Power" |
| "Discrimination" | "Vicarious Marginalization" |
| "Race Differences" | "Divergent Pathways to Legal Consciousness" |
| "Findings" | "Recognition Estrangement and the Labor of Disappearance" |

Subheadings name a **process or mechanism**, never a demographic or topic.

## Three Structural Archetypes

Choose an archetype based on your data and argument:

### Archetype A: The Mechanism List ("Three Buckets")

**Best for**: Distinct, non-linear findings where each section is a separate theoretical bucket.

**Structure**:
```
ROADMAP
├── Summarize all three mechanisms
└── Preview how they combine

MECHANISM 1: [Theoretical Name]
├── Analytic assertion
├── Anchor vignette (one deep case)
├── Echo quotes (2-3 showing prevalence)
└── Mechanism summary

MECHANISM 2: [Theoretical Name]
└── [Same structure]

MECHANISM 3: [Theoretical Name]
└── [Same structure]

INTEGRATION (optional)
├── How mechanisms combine
└── Cumulative or interactive effects
```

**Example**: A disaster recovery study uses three distinct mechanisms of inequality: Procedural Injustice → Vicarious Marginalization → Structural Exclusion.

---

### Archetype B: The Comparative ("Mirror")

**Best for**: Contrasting two distinct groups, contexts, or categories.

**Structure**:
```
ROADMAP
├── What groups share
├── Key divergence
└── Preview explanation

GROUP A: [Pattern Name]
├── Establish baseline pattern
├── Anchor vignette
├── Echo quotes
└── Group A summary

GROUP B: [Pattern Name]
├── Explicit contrast transition ("Unlike Group A...")
├── Anchor vignette
├── Echo quotes
└── Group B summary

EXPLAINING THE DIFFERENCE
├── Structural/institutional mechanism
├── Why context matters
└── Evidence for the explanation

CONVERGENCE (if applicable)
├── Shared pattern despite divergence
└── Why this convergence exists
```

**Example**: An elite careers study contrasts "Talent Meritocrats (UK)" vs. "Hard Work Meritocrats (Denmark)" before moving to "Institutional Amplifiers" that explain the difference.

---

### Archetype C: The Process ("Timeline")

**Best for**: Explaining a psychological or social trajectory over time or stages.

**Structure**:
```
ROADMAP
├── Name the trajectory
├── Identify stages
└── Preview outcome

STAGE 1: The Problem/Condition
├── What participants face
├── Anchor vignette
├── Echo quotes
└── Why this creates pressure

STAGE 2: The Reaction/Strategy
├── How participants respond
├── Anchor vignette showing strategy development
├── Echo quotes showing variation in strategies
└── What shapes different responses

STAGE 3: The Justification/Outcome
├── How participants make sense of their situation
├── Anchor vignette
├── Echo quotes
└── Consequences and implications
```

**Example**: A ghostwriting study flows from the problem ("Recognition Estrangement") to the reaction ("Securing Work") to the psychological justification ("Managing Estrangement").

## Section Length and Pacing

Each subsection typically runs **600-900 words**. To fill this space without rambling, use the "Anchor and Echo" pattern described in `prose-craft.md`.

---

## Variation Sequencing

**Critical rule**: Establish the baseline pattern first; only then introduce divergence.

No section begins with difference. All begin with commonality, then stratify.

**Correct sequence**:
1. "Most participants reported..." (establish baseline)
2. "This pattern held across [demographic variations]..." (confirm generality)
3. "However, [specific group] diverged in important ways..." (introduce variation)
4. Evidence for variation
5. Explanation for why variation occurs

**Incorrect sequence**:
- Starting with "Some participants said X while others said Y..."
- Listing differences without establishing what's shared
- Treating variation as a list or exception dump
