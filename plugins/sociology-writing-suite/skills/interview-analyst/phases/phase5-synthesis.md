# Phase 5: Synthesis & Writing

You are executing Phase 5 of a pragmatic qualitative analysis. Your goal is to **integrate everything into a coherent, well-evidenced argument** ready for presentation or publication.

## The Logic of Synthesis

Synthesis is where analysis becomes communication. You're transforming a rich, complex process into a compelling narrative that:
- Makes a clear argument
- Supports claims with evidence
- Anticipates objections
- Articulates contribution and limitations

As Lareau emphasizes: **show, don't tell**. Readers should see the evidence, not just trust your conclusions.

## Inputs

Before starting, read ALL prior outputs:
1. `/analysis/phase1-reports/` - Interview memos, initial observations
2. `/analysis/phase2-reports/` - Codebook, coded excerpts
3. `/analysis/phase3-reports/` - Patterns, explanations, theoretical connections
4. `/analysis/phase4-reports/` - Quality assessment, strengths, gaps addressed
5. Original transcripts in `/interviews/` for selecting quotes

## Your Tasks

### 1. Clarify the Core Argument

Before writing, articulate:

**The research question**: What did this study set out to explore?

**The central argument**: In 2-3 sentences, what is the main claim?

**The contribution**: What does this add to existing knowledge?
- Does it describe something previously undocumented?
- Does it explain patterns in a new way?
- Does it challenge existing assumptions?
- Does it extend or modify existing theory?

### 2. Structure the Argument

Develop an outline that moves readers through your analysis logically.

**Common structures for interview studies**:

**Structure A: Phenomenon → Patterns → Explanation**
1. Introduction to the phenomenon
2. Data and methods
3. Key patterns in the data
4. Explaining the patterns
5. Discussion and implications

**Structure B: Question → Cases → Comparative Analysis**
1. Research question and theoretical context
2. Data and methods
3. Case Type A (with analysis)
4. Case Type B (with analysis)
5. Comparison and theoretical implications

**Structure C: Process/Trajectory**
1. Introduction
2. Data and methods
3. Stage 1 of the process
4. Stage 2 of the process
5. Variation and contingencies
6. Theoretical implications

Choose a structure that fits your findings. Modify as needed.

### 3. Select Evidence

**Selecting quotes**:

Quotes should be **luminous exemplars**—not statistically typical, but analytically illuminating. A good quote:
- Illustrates a claim vividly
- Shows rather than tells
- Gives readers direct access to participant voice
- Does theoretical work (not just decoration)

**For each major claim, select**:
- 1-2 strong quotes that illustrate the point clearly
- Supporting quotes that show variation or additional dimensions
- Counter-examples or complicating cases (address, don't hide, complexity)

**Quote selection criteria**:
- Does this quote show what I'm claiming, or do I have to explain it heavily?
- Is there enough context for readers to understand?
- Does it feel representative, or is it cherry-picked?
- Does it let readers hear the participant's voice?

### 4. Address Alternative Explanations

Strong analysis anticipates objections:

- What other explanations could account for these patterns?
- Why is your interpretation more compelling than alternatives?
- What would someone skeptical of your claims say?
- How do you respond to potential criticisms?

Document this explicitly—it strengthens rather than weakens your argument.

### 5. Articulate Limitations

Be honest and specific:

**Sample limitations**:
- Who is included/excluded?
- How might the sample shape findings?
- What generalization is/isn't warranted?

**Method limitations**:
- What can interview data show vs. not show?
- What alternative methods might have revealed?
- What remains unobserved?

**Analytic limitations**:
- What couldn't you explain?
- What questions remain open?
- What would future research need to address?

### 6. Write Draft Sections

Produce drafts of key sections:

**Introduction** (1-2 pages):
- Hook: Why should readers care?
- Research question or puzzle
- Preview of argument
- Overview of data and approach
- Roadmap of paper

**Methods section** (1-2 pages):
- Data: What interviews, how many, with whom, when
- Sampling strategy and rationale
- Interview approach
- Analysis process
- Limitations acknowledgment
- Ethical considerations

**Methods Section: Detailed Templates**

The methods section must address five editorial expectations:

**1. Case Selection Logic:**
```markdown
We conducted interviews with [N] [PARTICIPANT TYPE]. Our target population
was [DEFINITION]. We used [SAMPLING STRATEGY: purposive, snowball, theoretical]
sampling to recruit participants who [SELECTION CRITERIA].

[If exclusions]: We excluded individuals who [CRITERIA] because [RATIONALE].
This may limit generalizability to [GROUPS/CONTEXTS].
```

**2. Recruitment Transparency:**
```markdown
Recruitment occurred through [CHANNELS: organizations, social media, referrals,
public records, etc.] between [DATES]. [If organizational access]: We gained
access through [GATEKEEPER/RELATIONSHIP], who [ROLE IN RECRUITMENT].

[If response rate calculable]: Of [N] individuals contacted, [X] agreed to
participate ([Y]% response rate). [If not calculable]: Due to [snowball/referral
sampling], we cannot calculate a traditional response rate.

[If refusals]: Those who declined cited [REASONS]. We [addressed/could not address]
potential selection by [METHOD].
```

**3. Sample Size Justification:**

Choose the approach that fits your study:

*Comparative Structure Approach:*
```markdown
Sample size was determined by our comparative design. We interviewed [N] participants
in [GROUP A] and [N] in [GROUP B] to enable systematic comparison across [DIMENSION].
This structure allows us to examine [RESEARCH QUESTION] while acknowledging that
findings may not capture [ADDITIONAL VARIATION].
```

*Population Coverage Approach:*
```markdown
Our sample includes [N] of the approximately [TOTAL] [POPULATION]. This [X]%
coverage allows us to [CLAIM TYPE] while acknowledging that [UNCOVERED PORTIONS]
may differ on [DIMENSIONS].
```

*Saturation Evidence Approach:*
```markdown
We continued interviewing until reaching thematic saturation, operationalized as
[DEFINITION: no new codes / no new themes / diminishing returns]. Saturation on
core themes emerged after approximately [N] interviews; we conducted [ADDITIONAL]
interviews to confirm the pattern and explore negative cases.
```

*Pragmatic Constraints Approach:*
```markdown
Our sample size was constrained by [FACTOR: access, population size, resources].
We mitigated this limitation by [METHOD: extended interviews, multiple interviews
per participant, intensive follow-up, triangulation with other data sources].
```

**4. Interview Protocol:**
```markdown
Interviews were [semi-structured / in-depth / life history], lasting [DURATION RANGE]
(average: [MEAN]). Topics included [MAJOR DOMAINS]. Interviews were conducted
[in person / by phone / by video] in [LANGUAGE], recorded with consent, and
transcribed [verbatim / with conventions].

[If repeat interviews]: We conducted [N] interviews with [X] participants to
capture [CHANGE/DEPTH].

[If supplementary data]: We also collected [DOCUMENTS, OBSERVATIONS, ETC.] to
[PURPOSE].
```

**5. Positionality (when appropriate):**
```markdown
[RELEVANT IDENTITIES] may have shaped data collection and interpretation.
[SPECIFIC INFLUENCE]: For example, [CONCRETE EXAMPLE of how positionality
affected access, rapport, interpretation, or blind spots]. We addressed this
by [MITIGATION STRATEGIES: member checks, peer debriefing, reflexive memos,
diverse research team].
```

**Findings sections** (bulk of paper):
- Organized by your chosen structure
- Each section makes a clear point
- Claims supported by evidence (quotes + analysis)
- Variation and negative cases addressed
- Clear transitions between sections

**Discussion** (1-2 pages):
- Summary of key findings
- Theoretical implications
- Connections to existing literature
- Scope conditions and limitations
- Future research directions

**Conclusion** (0.5-1 page):
- Core contribution restated
- Broader significance
- Closing thought

### 7. Build the Quote Database for Writeup

This is the key handoff to the interview-writeup skill. Reorganize the person-level material from Phase 2 participant profiles into a finding-level database ready for drafting.

**For each major finding/mechanism:**

```markdown
# Finding [N]: [Mechanism Name]
## [Sub-finding if applicable]

### Luminous Exemplar
The single best quote for opening this section—vivid, captures the mechanism perfectly, memorable.

> "[The quote]"
> —**[Name]**, [demographics], [role/position]
> *Context*: [What prompted this quote]
> *Why luminous*: [What makes this quote exceptional for this finding]

### Anchor Candidates
Participants who could serve as the deep vignette for this section. For each:
- **[Name]**: [1-sentence reason they exemplify this finding]
  - Extended quote available: Yes/No
  - Trajectory shows mechanism clearly: Yes/No
  - Social location adds analytical value: [How]

### Echo Candidates
Shorter quotes showing this pattern across multiple participants:

> "[Short quote]"
> —**[Name]**, [brief attribution]

> "[Short quote]"
> —**[Name]**, [brief attribution]

> "[Short quote]"
> —**[Name]**, [brief attribution]

### Prevalence
- Pattern appeared in [X] of [Y] participants ([Z]%)
- Variation by [demographic/position]: [notes]

### Negative Cases / Variation
- **[Name]**: [How they diverge from the pattern]
- Explanation for variation: [If known]
```

**Selection criteria for luminous exemplars:**
- Does it capture the mechanism in the participant's own voice?
- Is it vivid and memorable?
- Does it "show" rather than require extensive explanation?
- Would a reader remember this quote?

**Anchor vs. Echo distinction:**
- **Anchor**: Extended quote (3-6 sentences) from one person, developed into a vignette with context, interpretation, and follow-up. Go deep.
- **Echo**: Short quote (1-2 sentences) showing the same pattern appears in other participants. Show breadth.

**The writeup skill expects:**
- 1 anchor + 2-3 echoes per subsection
- Full demographics for attribution
- Context for extended quotes
- Prevalence indicators
- Variation/negative cases flagged

### 8. Create an Evidence Appendix

Compile:
- Key quotes organized by theme/claim
- Context for each quote (participant, circumstances)
- Additional quotes that didn't make the main text but support the analysis

This is useful for revision and for responding to reviewers.

**Note**: Methods section is now drafted in **Phase 6** via dispatch to `methods-writer`. The templates earlier in this document are preserved as reference, but the actual drafting happens through the specialized skill.

## Writing Principles

### Show, Don't Tell
```markdown
WEAK (telling):
"Participants experienced significant emotional challenges during their involvement."

STRONG (showing):
"The emotional toll was palpable. As Maria described, 'There were nights
I couldn't sleep, just replaying everything. The anger, the fear—it
doesn't just turn off when you go home.' This affective residue appeared
across interviews..."
```

### Ground Claims in Evidence
```markdown
WEAK:
"Relationships were important for sustained involvement."

STRONG:
"Fourteen of twenty long-term participants explicitly cited relationships
as central to their continued involvement. As P07 put it, 'The people keep
me coming back.' This relational embedding appeared to operate through..."
```

### Acknowledge Complexity
```markdown
WEAK:
"Participants joined because of ideological commitment."

STRONG:
"While most participants cited ideological reasons when asked why they joined,
closer examination revealed more complexity. Only four described ideology as
sufficient motivation; the majority paired ideological commitment with
relational or circumstantial factors..."
```

### Make Transitions Work
```markdown
WEAK:
"Another theme was organizational structure." [abrupt shift]

STRONG:
"If relational ties drew participants in, organizational structure shaped
what happened next. How the organization channeled new members' energy
proved consequential for their trajectories..." [connected transition]
```

## Guiding Principles

1. **Argument-driven**: Every section should advance your argument. Cut interesting material that doesn't serve the whole.

2. **Evidence-rich**: Claims need support. When in doubt, add another quote.

3. **Honest about limits**: Acknowledging what you can't claim strengthens what you can.

4. **Reader-oriented**: Write for someone unfamiliar with your data. What do they need to understand?

5. **Revise ruthlessly**: First drafts are for getting ideas down. Revision is where writing becomes good.

## Example Evidence Selection

```markdown
## Claim: Turning points were typically relational, not ideological

### Primary quote:
> "I wasn't political at all before this. Zero. What happened was my
> neighbor—she'd been going to meetings—she just asked me to come once.
> I went because she asked, not because I cared about the issue. But
> once I was there, meeting these people, seeing what they were doing...
> that's when it became real for me." — P12

**Why this quote**: Directly illustrates the relational nature of the turning
point. Also shows the sequence: relationship first, then ideological engagement.

### Supporting quotes:
> "My sister dragged me to that first meeting. Literally dragged me." — P03
> "It was [my friend's] passion that got me. I wanted to understand what
> made her care so much." — P08

### Counter-example to address:
> "I'd been reading about this for years. When I found out there was a local
> chapter, I showed up on my own. Didn't know anyone." — P02

**How to handle**: Acknowledge this as genuine ideological pathway, but note
its rarity (2 of 20 participants) and that even P02 describes subsequent
relational embedding as crucial for continued involvement.
