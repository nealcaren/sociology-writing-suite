# Phase 0: Theory Synthesis (Track A Only)

You are executing Phase 0 of a pragmatic qualitative analysis. Your goal is to synthesize the theoretical resources the user has provided to inform subsequent analysis of interview data.

**Note**: This phase is only for Track A (theory-informed) analyses. Track B (data-first) analyses skip directly to Phase 1.

## Purpose

Unlike approaches that demand comprehensive theoretical mastery before touching data, this phase aims for **practical theoretical sensitivity**—enough familiarity with relevant frameworks to:
- Notice patterns that connect to existing knowledge
- Recognize when something doesn't fit expectations
- Have vocabulary for what you're seeing
- Know what conversations your findings might contribute to

You are not trying to force data into theoretical boxes. You are developing lenses that might prove useful.

## Inputs

Read all materials in `/theory`. These may include:
- Academic papers or book chapters
- Literature review notes
- Theoretical summaries
- The user's own notes on relevant frameworks

## Your Tasks

### 1. Inventory the Materials

Create a list of all theoretical resources provided:
- What frameworks, theories, or concepts are represented?
- What substantive domains do they address?
- What levels of analysis (micro, meso, macro)?

### 2. Summarize Key Frameworks

For each major theoretical framework or perspective in the materials:

**Framework Name**:
- **Core argument**: What does this theory claim?
- **Key concepts**: What are the central terms and their definitions?
- **Mechanisms**: What processes or dynamics does it identify?
- **Scope conditions**: When does this framework apply? What are its limits?
- **Empirical expectations**: What would we expect to see in data if this framework is correct?

Keep summaries concise—aim for clarity, not comprehensiveness.

### 3. Identify Connections and Tensions

- Where do frameworks **converge**? What do multiple perspectives agree on?
- Where do they **diverge**? What do they disagree about or explain differently?
- What **gaps** exist? What questions don't current frameworks address well?

### 4. Generate Sensitizing Questions

Based on the theoretical materials, develop questions to bring to the data. These should be open enough to allow for discovery but specific enough to direct attention.

Format:
```
From [Framework X]:
- [Question that this framework would prompt you to ask of the data]
- [Another question]

From [Framework Y]:
- [Question]
```

Also note any **tensions between frameworks** that the data might help adjudicate:
- "Framework X predicts [A], while Framework Y predicts [B]. The data may show which better captures participants' experiences."

### 5. Create a Theoretical Reference Sheet

Produce a concise reference document that can be consulted during later phases:
- Key concepts with brief definitions
- Central mechanisms identified in the literature
- Main debates or unresolved questions
- Sensitizing questions organized by theme

## Output Files to Create

Save all outputs to `/analysis/phase0-reports/`:

1. **materials-inventory.md** - List of all theoretical resources reviewed
2. **framework-summaries.md** - Summaries of each major framework
3. **connections-tensions.md** - Analysis of how frameworks relate
4. **sensitizing-questions.md** - Questions to bring to the data
5. **theory-reference-sheet.md** - Concise reference for later phases
6. **phase0-report.md** - Executive summary including:
   - Overview of theoretical landscape
   - Most relevant frameworks for this analysis
   - Key sensitizing questions
   - Gaps or tensions to attend to
   - Questions for the user

## Guiding Principles

1. **Synthesis, not exhaustion**: You don't need to capture everything. Focus on what's most likely to be useful for analyzing the interview data.

2. **Practical orientation**: Ask "How would this framework direct my attention when reading transcripts?" not just "What does this theory say?"

3. **Maintain pluralism**: Don't pick a winner yet. The point is to have multiple lenses available.

4. **Note what's missing**: If the user's theoretical materials seem to have gaps, note them. The user may want to add resources, or it may be fine to proceed.

5. **Stay humble**: Theoretical sensitivity is a tool, not a straitjacket. The data may surprise you in ways the theories don't anticipate.

## Example Framework Summary

```markdown
### Resource Mobilization Theory

**Core argument**: Social movement participation depends on the availability
of resources (money, time, skills, networks) that can be mobilized for
collective action. Grievances are ubiquitous; what varies is capacity to act.

**Key concepts**:
- *Resources*: tangible (money, space) and intangible (skills, legitimacy)
- *Mobilizing structures*: organizations and networks that facilitate action
- *Social movement organizations (SMOs)*: formal organizations that pursue movement goals

**Mechanisms**:
- Organizations aggregate resources and lower individual costs of participation
- Pre-existing networks provide recruitment channels
- Professional activists maintain continuity

**Scope conditions**:
- Better explains organized, sustained movements than spontaneous protest
- More applicable to resource-rich contexts

**Empirical expectations**:
- Participants will describe organizational involvement
- Network ties will figure prominently in recruitment stories
- Resource constraints will appear as barriers to participation
```

## Example Sensitizing Questions

```markdown
### From Resource Mobilization Theory:
- What resources do participants describe drawing on?
- How did organizations facilitate (or fail to facilitate) their participation?
- What role did pre-existing networks play in recruitment?

### From Identity-Based Approaches:
- How do participants connect their involvement to who they are?
- What identity claims or transformations appear in their accounts?
- How does participation relate to other identities they hold?

### Tensions to Explore:
- Resource mobilization emphasizes organizational capacity; identity
  approaches emphasize meaning and selfhood. Do participants' accounts
  foreground one over the other? Do they integrate both?
```
