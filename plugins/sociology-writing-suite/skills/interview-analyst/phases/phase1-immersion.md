# Phase 1: Immersion & Familiarization

You are executing Phase 1 of a pragmatic qualitative analysis. Your goal is to develop deep familiarity with the interview data—to know these transcripts intimately before attempting systematic analysis.

## The Logic of Immersion

As Gerson & Damaske emphasize, "the immersion process is not just an extension of conducting interviews." Even if someone has already read these transcripts, the analytic task requires reading them differently—with an eye toward patterns, connections, and puzzles that will only become visible when considering the full dataset.

This phase is about **acquaintance before analysis**. You are getting to know the data, not yet trying to explain it.

## Inputs

**For Track A (Theory-Informed)**:
- Read `/analysis/phase0-reports/sensitizing-questions.md` and `/analysis/phase0-reports/theory-reference-sheet.md`
- Keep theoretical frameworks in mind as lenses, not as conclusions

**For Track B (Data-First)**:
- Use the General Sensitizing Questions below
- Stay open to what emerges

**Both tracks**: Read all interview transcripts in `/interviews`

## General Sensitizing Questions (Track B, or supplementary for Track A)

When reading interviews, attend to:

**Action & Process**
- What do people DO? What actions, practices, routines?
- What sequences or trajectories emerge? What are the turning points?
- How do things unfold over time?

**Meaning & Interpretation**
- How do participants make sense of their experiences?
- What matters to them? What do they value, fear, hope for?
- What language and metaphors do they use?

**Identity & Self**
- How do people describe themselves?
- How does the phenomenon relate to who they are?
- What identities are claimed, rejected, or negotiated?

**Relationships & Networks**
- Who matters in their accounts? Who's present, who's absent?
- How do relationships enable or constrain action?
- What social contexts shape their experiences?

**Resources & Constraints**
- What do people draw on? (time, money, skills, knowledge, support)
- What limits or blocks them?
- What's possible vs. impossible in their world?

**Emotion & Affect**
- What feelings are expressed or implied?
- What evokes strong reactions?
- What's the emotional texture of their experience?

**Contradictions & Tensions**
- Where do accounts seem inconsistent?
- What dilemmas or trade-offs do people navigate?
- What don't they talk about?

## Your Tasks

### 1. Read Every Interview

Read each transcript carefully and completely. Pay attention to:
- What participants say at length vs. briefly
- Tone, emphasis, hedging, certainty
- Emotional moments
- What seems to matter most to them
- What is NOT said—silences, deflections, avoided topics

### 2. Create Interview Memos

For each interview, produce a memo that includes:

```markdown
## Interview Memo: [Participant ID]

**Basic Information**:
- [Any demographic or contextual details mentioned]

**Overview**:
- [2-3 sentence summary of this person's account]

**Main Topics & Perspectives**:
- [Topic 1]: [Their stance/experience]
- [Topic 2]: [Their stance/experience]

**Notable Quotes** (2-4 excerpts that capture something important):
> "Quote" (context: discussing X)

**What Stood Out**:
- [Anything surprising, puzzling, or particularly striking]

**Emotional Tenor**:
- [How did they seem to feel about what they discussed?]

**Initial Questions**:
- [Questions this interview raises for you]

**Potential Connections**:
- [How might this interview relate to others?]
```

### 3. Track Emerging Observations

As you read across interviews, maintain running notes on:

**Patterns beginning to emerge**:
- What do multiple participants talk about similarly?
- What common experiences, concerns, or framings appear?

**Variation you're noticing**:
- Where do participants differ?
- What seems to explain those differences?

**Surprises**:
- What didn't you expect?
- What challenges assumptions (yours or conventional)?

**Puzzles**:
- What doesn't make sense yet?
- What would you need to understand better?

**Potential groupings**:
- Are there types or categories emerging?
- Which participants seem similar to each other?

### 4. Note Questions for Later Phases

What questions should inform coding (Phase 2)?
What will need explanation (Phase 3)?
What might the user need to weigh in on?

## Output Files to Create

Save all outputs to `/analysis/phase1-reports/`:

1. **interview-memos.md** - All individual interview memos
2. **emerging-observations.md** - Patterns, variation, surprises, puzzles
3. **initial-questions.md** - Questions for later phases
4. **phase1-report.md** - Executive summary including:
   - Overview of dataset (number of interviews, participant characteristics)
   - Key observations from immersion
   - Most striking patterns or variations
   - Surprises and puzzles
   - Preliminary thoughts on potential groupings
   - Questions for the user
   - Recommendations for Phase 2 focus

## Guiding Principles

1. **Read generously**: Try to understand each participant on their own terms before comparing or judging.

2. **Stay descriptive**: Resist the urge to explain. "I notice X" is better than "X means Y" at this stage.

3. **Embrace uncertainty**: If something is confusing, that's data. Flag it rather than resolving it prematurely.

4. **Notice both patterns and exceptions**: The person who doesn't fit the pattern is as important as those who do.

5. **Preserve context**: When excerpting quotes, include enough context to understand them later.

6. **Trust the process**: You don't need to have it figured out. Immersion builds the foundation for everything that follows.

## Reading Stance

Approach each transcript asking:
- What is this person trying to tell me?
- What matters to them about this?
- What would I need to know to understand their experience from the inside?
- What surprises me? What confirms my expectations?
- How does this compare to other interviews I've read?

## Example Interview Memo

```markdown
## Interview Memo: Participant 07

**Basic Information**:
- Female, mid-40s, joined organization in 2018, currently in leadership role

**Overview**:
Describes a gradual deepening of involvement that she frames as
"accidental"—she came for one event and kept getting pulled in. Strong
emphasis on relationships with other members as what keeps her engaged.

**Main Topics & Perspectives**:
- Initial involvement: Came to support a friend, not personally committed to cause
- Escalation: Took on small tasks, then larger roles "before I knew it"
- Current role: Reluctant leader—feels obligated but also energized
- Costs: Significant time strain on family; some tension with spouse

**Notable Quotes**:
> "I always say I backed into this. I never meant to be the person running
> things. But someone had to, and I was there." (discussing how she became
> co-chair)

> "The people keep me coming back. The cause matters, don't get me wrong,
> but if it wasn't for [names several members], I don't know if I'd still
> be doing this." (discussing motivation)

**What Stood Out**:
- Tension between framing involvement as "accidental" while also describing
  clear choice points where she could have stepped back
- Relationship-centered account contrasts with some other participants who
  lead with ideology

**Emotional Tenor**:
- Warm when discussing relationships; somewhat stressed when discussing
  time costs; proud but self-deprecating about leadership role

**Initial Questions**:
- Is the "accidental" framing a way of managing the identity implications
  of deep commitment?
- How common is this relationship-centered pathway?

**Potential Connections**:
- Similar to P03 and P11 in emphasizing relationships
- Contrasts with P02 and P09 who lead with ideological commitment
```
