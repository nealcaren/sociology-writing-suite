# Phase 2: Drafting

## Why This Phase Matters

This is where planning becomes prose. The quality of your abstract depends on sentence-level craft—how you open, describe data, preview findings, and close with contribution. This phase transforms the move sequence into a publication-ready abstract.

---

## Default Behavior: Multiple Variants

**By default, draft 2-3 abstract variants** using different archetypes so users can compare approaches:

1. **Primary variant**: The recommended archetype from Phase 0
2. **Alternative variant**: A strong alternative archetype that could also work
3. **Optional third variant**: If another archetype offers distinct advantages

For each variant, draft a complete abstract following that archetype's templates and patterns. This gives users options and helps them see how different framings emphasize different strengths of their work.

**Common pairings**:
- Research-Report + Puzzle-Solver (scholarly vs. curiosity-driven)
- Empirical-Showcase + Research-Report (phenomenon-led vs. literature-led)
- Stakes-Driven + Empirical-Showcase (importance-led vs. phenomenon-led)

## Your Tasks

### 1. Draft by Sentence

Work through the sequence plan one sentence at a time. For each:

**Step 1: Check function**
- What move is this sentence performing?
- What information must it convey?

**Step 2: Apply archetype template**
- Use sentence patterns from the archetype profile
- Match the expected style for this move

**Step 3: Track word count**
- Target ~29 words per sentence
- Adjust to stay within 180-200 total

**Step 4: Connect to next sentence**
- Ensure logical flow
- Use transition phrases where needed

### 2. Draft by Move Type

Apply move-specific guidance:

#### OPEN-PHENOMENON (Empirical-Showcase)

Describe observable social phenomenon that grounds your research.

**Template options**:
- [Group/phenomenon] [verb describing pattern] [description].
- [Event] has [consequence] for [population].
- [Social condition] characterizes [context/population].

**Examples from corpus**:
> "Elites often use merit to explain, justify, and make sense of their advantaged positions."

> "The Stanford Financial Group's 2009 collapse devastated more than 20,000 depositors across the Americas."

> "Racial disparities in police-community encounters are well documented, with people of color experiencing higher levels of police scrutiny."

---

#### PRIOR-RESEARCH (Research-Report)

Position study within scholarly conversation.

**Template options**:
- [Scholars/Research/A robust literature] has shown that [finding].
- [Topic] has received [attention level] in [field].
- Research demonstrates that [finding]; however, [limitation].

**Examples from corpus**:
> "A robust literature has shown that surveillance disproportionately targets poor people of color through the criminal justice and welfare systems."

> "Scholars underline the persistence of gender disparities in the household division of labor."

---

#### OPEN-RESEARCH (Research-Report variant)

State research focus directly.

**Template options**:
- This study [verb] [topic].
- This study of [topic] contributes [contribution type] to [field].

**Examples from corpus**:
> "This study investigates the social incorporation of unaccompanied, undocumented Latinx youth workers as they come of age in the United States."

---

#### OPEN-STAKES (Stakes-Driven)

Establish importance, urgency, or change.

**Template options**:
- [Group/phenomenon] [increasingly/currently] [verb] [description of change].
- [Topic] is [important/critical/central] because...
- With the [expansion/growth/change] of [trend], [consequence].

**Examples from corpus**:
> "Women increasingly work for pay, disrupting cultural expectations and relational dynamics tied to men's breadwinning."

> "Many professional labor markets are currently experiencing signs of deprofessionalization, including automation of tasks and increasingly unstable employment conditions."

---

#### OPEN-PUZZLE (Puzzle-Solver)

Pose explicit question.

**Template options**:
- How does [X] [verb] [consequence]?
- How do [actors] [verb] [action]?
- What [happens/explains] when [condition]?

**Examples from corpus**:
> "How does conspiracist thinking become appealing to its adherents, and with what political consequences?"

> "How do real-estate investors make decisions about where to purchase properties?"

---

#### GAP

Identify limitation in existing knowledge.

**Template options**:
- However, [gap in knowledge].
- Yet, few [studies/scholars] have [addressed X].
- Little [research/attention] has [examined Y].
- Although [X], little is known about [Y].

**Examples from corpus**:
> "However, little empirical research traces the mechanisms through which surveillance reproduces inequality in other domains, such as subsidized housing."

> "Despite the ubiquitous nature of racist and sexist discourses online, relatively little is known about how people respond to online inequalities."

---

#### STUDY-FOCUS

State what your study examines.

**Template options**:
- This [study/article/paper] examines [specific aspect].
- [Transition phrase], this article explores [focus].
- In this paper, we [verb] [focus].

**Examples from corpus**:
> "This study examines how mothers in doubled-up households negotiate identity and dignity."

> "We examine how people construct what it means to be an ally to marginalized groups."

---

#### DATA-DESCRIBE

Describe your interview data.

**Template options**:
- Drawing on [N] in-depth interviews with [population] in [location], [I/we] [verb]...
- Based on [N] interviews with [population], [finding preview].
- Using interview data with [N] [population], [I/we] find...
- Through [N] interviews with [population]...

**Examples from corpus**:
> "Drawing on in-depth interviews with 67 low-income Black mothers in the Sunnyside neighborhood in Houston, Texas, I argue that..."

> "Based on 70 in-depth interviews with college students who identify as allies to one or more marginalized groups, we analyze..."

Preview key results.

**Template options**:
- [We/I] find that [finding].
- Findings show that [result].
- Our results indicate that [finding].
- [We/I] argue that [finding].

**Examples from corpus**:
> "Our results indicate that while elites in both countries are united by a common concern to frame their merits as spontaneously recognized by others, the package of attributes they foreground vary significantly."

> "We find that the combination of these strategies allows them to claim identities as allies without having to engage in concrete efforts that could challenge systems of oppression."

**Additional findings**:
- Moreover, [additional finding].
- [First group] [verb], whereas [second group] [verb].
- Specifically, [elaboration].

#### CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION

State your contribution.

**Template options**:
- This [research/work/study] demonstrates [contribution].
- These findings suggest that [broader implication].
- [We/I] argue that [contribution to understanding].
- This article shows [what we now know].

**Common verbs**: argue, demonstrate, show, reveal, suggest, extend, illuminate, advance, contribute

**Examples from corpus**:
> "These findings suggest that nationally specific understandings of merit can have quite different implications for the legitimation of inequality."

### 3. Track Word Count

After each sentence:
- Record word count
- Adjust if running long or short
- Target 180-200 words total

### 4. Check Transition Flow

Ensure smooth connections:

| Transition Point | Phrase Options |
|-----------------|----------------|
| OPEN to STUDY-FOCUS | "This study examines...", "This article explores...", "In this paper, we..." |
| DATA to FINDINGS | "Findings show that...", "We find that...", "I find that..." |
| FINDINGS to CLOSE | "This research demonstrates...", "These findings suggest...", "Taken together..." |

### 5. Apply First-Person Appropriately

**First-person usage patterns** (from corpus):
- 62% of abstracts use first person
- "We find that..." is most common
- "I argue that..." for single-authored work
- "This study shows..." as alternative

### 6. Assemble Complete Draft

Combine all sentences into a single paragraph. Read aloud for flow.

---

## Guiding Principles

### Every Word Must Earn Its Place
180 words is tight. Cut ruthlessly.

### Draft, Then Polish
Get words on the page first. Refinement comes in Phase 3.

### Follow the Sequence
The move sequence exists for a reason. Don't skip moves.

### Findings Are Central
Devote 40% of your abstract to findings preview.

### The Closing Is Your Claim
Don't let it trail off. State your contribution explicitly.

---

## Common Drafting Problems

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Too long** | Cut elaboration, tighten sentences |
| **Too short** | Expand findings, add specificity |
| **Vague findings** | Add concrete details: who, what, how |
| **Weak closing** | Use strong verbs: demonstrate, show, argue |
| **No transition** | Add connecting phrase between moves |
| **Opening too long** | Get to study focus faster |
