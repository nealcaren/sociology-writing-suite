# Phase 3: Revision

## Why This Phase Matters

Good writing is rewriting. The draft from Phase 2 needs polishing: checking calibration against norms, ensuring all essential moves are present, strengthening the closing, and achieving prose quality worthy of publication. This phase transforms a competent draft into a compelling abstract.

## Your Tasks

### 1. Calibration Check

Compare draft against benchmarks:

| Metric | Target (IQR) | Your Draft | Status |
|--------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Word count | 166-201 | [actual] | [ ] OK / [ ] Adjust |
| Sentence count | 5-7 | [actual] | [ ] OK / [ ] Adjust |
| Words per sentence | ~29 | [actual] | [ ] OK / [ ] Adjust |

**If outside target range**:
- **Under 165 words**: Expand findings, add specificity
- **Over 210 words**: Cut elaboration, tighten prose
- **Under 5 sentences**: Add essential moves or split long sentences
- **Over 8 sentences**: Combine sentences or cut redundancy

### 2. Essential Moves Audit

Verify all essential moves are present:

| Move | Frequency | Present? | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------|-------|
| STUDY-FOCUS | 90% | [ ] | What study examines |
| DATA-DESCRIBE | 87% | [ ] | Interview sample description |
| FINDINGS | 95% | [ ] | 2-3 sentences typically |
| CLOSE (any type) | 100% | [ ] | Contribution, implications, or findings |

**If missing an essential move**: Add it before proceeding.

### 3. Opening Move Check

Verify the opening matches the archetype:

| Archetype | Opening Should... | Check |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Empirical-Showcase | Describe observable phenomenon | [ ] |
| Research-Report | Position in literature OR state study | [ ] |
| Stakes-Driven | Establish importance/urgency/change | [ ] |
| Puzzle-Solver | Pose explicit question | [ ] |

**If opening doesn't match archetype**: Either revise the opening or reconsider the archetype choice.

### 4. Closing Sentence Check

The closing is your contribution claim. Verify:

1. **Strong verb**: Does it use argue, demonstrate, show, reveal, extend, illuminate, or similar?
2. **Explicit contribution**: Does it state what the study contributes (not just what it finds)?
3. **Specific claim**: Is it concrete rather than vague?

**Weak closing signs**:
- Ends with a finding rather than a claim
- Uses passive construction
- Is vague ("contributes to our understanding")
- Trails off without emphasis

**Strong closing patterns**:
> "This research demonstrates that [specific contribution]."
> "These findings suggest that [broader implication]."
> "This study extends our understanding of [specific aspect] by showing [contribution]."

### 5. Findings Adequacy Check

Findings should:
- Occupy 2-4 sentences (~40% of abstract)
- Be specific (who, what, how)
- Preview the main discoveries
- Use concrete language

**Weak findings signs**:
- Only 1 sentence of findings
- Vague descriptions ("various strategies")
- No sense of what was discovered

**Strengthen findings by**:
- Adding a second/third findings sentence
- Naming specific patterns, mechanisms, or types
- Including comparative or contrastive elements

### 6. Transition Check

Between every sentence, verify:
- Logical connection exists
- Explicit transition phrase where needed
- No abrupt shifts

**Common transition phrases**:
- OPEN to STUDY-FOCUS: "This study examines...", "This article explores..."
- DATA to FINDINGS: "Findings show that...", "We find that..."
- FINDINGS to CLOSE: "This research demonstrates...", "These findings suggest..."

### 7. Prose Polish

Read the entire abstract for prose quality:

- **Sentence variety**: Mix structure where possible
- **Active voice**: Prefer "We find" over "It was found"
- **Concrete language**: Avoid vague abstractions
- **Jargon check**: Is technical terminology necessary?
- **Read aloud**: Does it flow when spoken?

### 8. Archetype Consistency Check

Verify the abstract maintains archetype style throughout:

| Archetype | Style Check |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Empirical-Showcase** | Phenomenon-grounded? Discovery-oriented? |
| **Research-Report** | Efficiently structured? Literature-positioned? |
| **Stakes-Driven** | Importance established? Implications present? |
| **Puzzle-Solver** | Question framed? Answer provided? |

### 9. Final Checklist

Before completion, verify:

- [ ] Word count in target range (166-201)
- [ ] Sentence count in target range (5-7)
- [ ] Opening move matches archetype
- [ ] STUDY-FOCUS present
- [ ] DATA-DESCRIBE present (number, population, location)
- [ ] FINDINGS present (2-3 sentences)
- [ ] Closing sentence has strong verb
- [ ] Closing states contribution (not just findings)
- [ ] Transitions smooth
- [ ] Prose reads clearly
- [ ] Single paragraph format
- [ ] No citations (unless rare exception)

### 10. Write Quality Memo

Create quality assessment:

# Abstract Quality Assessment

## Calibration Results

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Word count | 166-201 | [N] | [status] |
| Sentence count | 5-7 | [N] | [status] |
| Words per sentence | ~29 | [N] | [status] |

## Move Audit

| Move | Present | Position | Quality |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| Opening ([type]) | [Y/N] | S1 | [assessment] |
| STUDY-FOCUS | [Y/N] | S[N] | [assessment] |
| DATA-DESCRIBE | [Y/N] | S[N] | [assessment] |
| FINDINGS | [Y/N] | S[N]-S[N] | [assessment] |
| Closing ([type]) | [Y/N] | S[N] | [assessment] |

## Quality Assessment

### Opening Sentence
[Assessment of opening effectiveness]

### Findings Preview
[Assessment of findings clarity and specificity]

### Closing Sentence
[Assessment of contribution claim strength]

### Prose Quality
[Assessment of readability and flow]

## Revisions Made
- [List changes from draft to final]

## Remaining Considerations
- [Any issues that are judgment calls]

## Confidence Assessment
[High/Medium/Low confidence abstract is publication-ready]
```

## Guiding Principles

### Revision Is Not Just Proofreading
This phase is about structural integrity and contribution clarity—not just comma placement.

### When in Doubt, Strengthen the Closing
The last sentence is what readers remember. Make it count.

### Specificity Always Wins
"X among Y in Z context" beats "X generally."

### Respect the Word Limit
If you're over 210 words, something must go. Cut elaboration, not essential moves.

### The Abstract Should Stand Alone
A reader should understand your contribution from the abstract alone.

## Common Revision Issues

| Issue | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Too long** | Over 210 words | Cut elaboration, tighten sentences |
| **Too short** | Under 165 words | Expand findings, add specificity |
| **Weak opening** | Generic or unclear | Revise to match archetype |
| **Weak closing** | No contribution claim | Add explicit demonstration statement |
| **Vague findings** | No concrete details | Add specificity: who, what, how |
| **Missing move** | Essential move absent | Add the missing move |
| **Wrong archetype** | Opening doesn't fit | Reconsider archetype or revise opening |
| **Choppy flow** | Abrupt transitions | Add connecting phrases |
