# Phase 0: Assessment

## Why This Phase Matters

The single most important decision in abstract writing is **archetype selection**. The archetype determines your opening move, sentence sequence, and closing strategy. Getting this wrong means writing an abstract that doesn't match your contribution—confusing readers about what kind of study this is.

This phase ensures you make a deliberate, informed choice about which style fits your project.

## Your Tasks

### 1. Gather Project Information

Collect from the user:

**Required**:
- Research question(s)
- Main argument or contribution claim
- Data description (number of interviews, population, location)
- Key findings (2-3 main results)

**Helpful**:
- Target journal (if known)
- Existing draft (if revising)
- How they want to position the research (phenomenon-led, gap-filling, etc.)

### 2. Apply the Archetype Decision Tree

Work through this diagnostic to recommend an archetype:

```
What should your FIRST SENTENCE do?

├── Describe an observable social phenomenon?
│   └── The phenomenon is compelling, surprising, or dramatic?
│   └── Readers don't need literature context?
│       └── ARCHETYPE 1: Empirical-Showcase
│
├── Position within scholarly conversation?
│   └── Literature, prior research, or "This study..." opener?
│   └── Gap-filling contribution?
│       └── ARCHETYPE 2: Research-Report
│
├── Establish why the topic matters?
│   └── Importance, urgency, change, or disruption?
│   └── Policy-relevant implications?
│       └── ARCHETYPE 3: Stakes-Driven
│
└── Ask a question?
    └── Explicit "How...?" or "What...?" question?
    └── Study definitively answers the puzzle?
        └── ARCHETYPE 4: Puzzle-Solver
```

### 3. Review Archetype Profile

Once you have a candidate archetype, read the detailed profile:
- `clusters/empirical-showcase.md`
- `clusters/research-report.md`
- `clusters/stakes-driven.md`
- `clusters/puzzle-solver.md`

Verify the profile matches the user's project.

### 4. Consider Secondary Factors

If the decision tree isn't definitive, consider:

| Factor | Empirical-Showcase | Research-Report | Stakes-Driven | Puzzle-Solver |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Audience** | Broad readership | Subfield specialists | Policy-oriented | Theory-curious |
| **Contribution** | Empirical discovery | Gap-filling | Policy implications | Puzzle resolution |
| **Findings** | Surprising/dramatic | Extends literature | Has implications | Answers question |
| **Length need** | Standard (6.5 sent) | Flexible (6.4 sent) | Longer (7 sent) | Standard (6.6 sent) |

### 5. Write Assessment Memo

Create the assessment memo with:

```markdown
# Abstract Assessment

## Project Summary
- Research question: [summarize]
- Main argument: [summarize]
- Data: [N] interviews with [population] in [location]
- Key findings: [list 2-3]

## Archetype Analysis

### Decision Tree Path
[Walk through the logic of the decision tree]

### Primary Recommendation: [Archetype Name]

**Why this fits**:
[2-3 sentences explaining the match between project and archetype]

**What this means**:
- Opening move: [description]
- Typical length: [X] sentences, [Y] words
- Closing strategy: [contribution/implications/findings]

---

### Alternative Considered: [Archetype Name]

**Why this might fit**: [1-2 sentences]

**What would make this preferable**: [specific conditions]

**Trade-off**: [what you gain vs. lose]

---

## Archetype Implications

| Feature | Recommendation |
|---------|---------------|
| Opening move | [specific move type] |
| Sentence count | [target] |
| Word count | [target range] |
| Closing move | [type] |

## Questions for User
- [Any clarifying questions before proceeding]
```

### 6. Present Recommendation

Present to user with clear structure:

1. **Your primary recommendation** with rationale
2. **One alternative** with what would make it preferable
3. **Decision factors** that could shift your recommendation
4. **Questions** you have before proceeding

**Important**: Let the user choose—don't assume they'll take the primary. Some users know their project better and may prefer the alternative.

## Guiding Principles

### When in Doubt, Choose Research-Report
It's the most common (43%) and safest approach. Clear, efficient, professional.

### Empirical-Showcase Requires Compelling Phenomena
Don't use this archetype unless your phenomenon is genuinely compelling or dramatic. Otherwise, it may feel underdeveloped.

### Stakes-Driven Requires Genuine Significance
Only choose Stakes-Driven if you can articulate why the topic is important without it sounding like throat-clearing.

### Puzzle-Solver is Rare for a Reason
Only 6% of abstracts use this form. It requires a genuine, answerable question—not a rhetorical one.

### Archetype Can Shift
If you realize during sequencing that a different archetype fits better, you can adjust. But starting with the right archetype prevents rewrites.

## Output Files to Create

1. **assessment-memo.md** - Full assessment with archetype recommendation

## When You're Done

Report to the orchestrator:
- Recommended archetype
- Key rationale (2-3 sentences)
- Any outstanding questions
- Readiness assessment for Phase 1

Example summary:
> "I recommend **Archetype 2: Research-Report** for this project. The user is studying how unaccompanied immigrant youth navigate work—a gap-filling contribution that positions within existing literature on immigrant incorporation. The user has 54 interviews and clear findings about institutional context and ethnic networks. Ready for Phase 1: Sequencing."
