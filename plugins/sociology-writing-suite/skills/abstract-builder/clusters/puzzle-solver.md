# Archetype 4: Puzzle-Solver

**Prevalence**: 5 abstracts (5.5% of corpus, least common)

## Overview

**Definition**: Abstracts that open with an explicit question, framing the study as providing an answer to a specific puzzle or problem.

**Strategic Purpose**: Hook reader with compelling question. Create intellectual engagement. Position study as resolution to puzzle.

## When to Use This Archetype

Use Puzzle-Solver when:
- You have a specific question your study answers
- You want to create intellectual engagement
- Problem-solution structure fits your work
- Your contribution is answering a puzzle
- You want to hook readers with curiosity

**Best for**: Clear, answerable research questions; when curiosity is your hook; engagement-focused writing; when your study definitively answers something.

## Signature Moves

### Required Moves

| Move | Frequency | Position | Function |
|------|-----------|----------|----------|
| OPEN-PUZZLE | 100% | 1 | Pose explicit question |
| DATA-DESCRIBE | 80% | 2 | Quick transition to data |
| STUDY-FOCUS | 100% | 2-3 | Research approach |
| FINDINGS | 100% | 3-6 | Answer the question |
| CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION or CLOSE-FINDINGS | 100% | Final | Split: 60% contribution, 40% findings |

**Note**: Puzzle-Solver often moves quickly from question to data, with less contextual framing than other archetypes.

## Move Sequence Pattern

**Typical sequence**:
```
S1: OPEN-PUZZLE (question)
S2: DATA-DESCRIBE
S3: STUDY-FOCUS
S4: FINDINGS
S5: FINDINGS
S6: CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION
```

## Opening Sentence Patterns

### Pattern A: "How does [X] [verb]?"

> "How does conspiracist thinking become appealing to its adherents, and with what political consequences?"

> "How do real-estate investors make decisions about where to purchase properties?"

> "How does the victimization of women's bodies in medical interactions contribute to their experience of gendered violence?"

### Pattern B: "What happens when [condition]?"

> "Middle-class households typically search for housing with an eye to long-term residence and are able to maintain a high level of stability, but what happens when these households are forced to make mobility decisions after exposure to a disaster and subsequent residential displacement?"

### Pattern C: [Context], then question

> "[Context sentence]. In other words, how do potential lenders manage to say no without saying no?"

## Closing Sentence Patterns

### Pattern A: "Our analysis illuminates..."

> "Extending existing accounts of conspiracism, our analysis illuminates how conspiracist thinking--as an active, and self-reinforcing, struggle for epistemological control amid contexts of information scarcity and uncertainty--has come to shape American politics from the bottom up."

### Pattern B: "Our findings reveal..."

> "Our findings reveal the role of plans in the residential decision-making of middle-class households and have implications for understanding post-disaster immobility..."

### Pattern C: "This paper outlines..."

> "This paper outlines different strategies of obfuscation among adults trying to improve their financial lives and the contingencies at play as a ruse is abandoned in favor of a direct refusal to lend."

### Pattern D: "Our research demonstrates..."

> "Our research demonstrates that clinicians and hospitals are harming patients, often through the normal application of established hospital protocols and behaviors, when women do not feel involved in decisions about their care."

## Transition Phrases

**PUZZLE to DATA-DESCRIBE**:

## Checklist

Before finalizing a Puzzle-Solver abstract, verify:

- [ ] Opening sentence poses explicit question (usually "How...?" or "What...?")
- [ ] Question is genuine (not rhetorical or obvious)
- [ ] Question is answerable by your study
- [ ] Data description appears early (position 2)
- [ ] Findings explicitly answer the question
- [ ] Closing illuminates contribution or reveals implications
- [ ] Total: 4-10 sentences, 139-238 words
- [ ] Structure feels like question -> answer -> significance

## Question Quality Check

Not all questions work for Puzzle-Solver:

| Good Questions | Bad Questions |
|----------------|---------------|
| "How does X lead to Y?" | "What does this study examine?" |
| "How do [actors] [verb]?" | "Why is X important?" |
| "What happens when [condition]?" | "What do we know about X?" |
| Genuine puzzle with answer | Rhetorical or framing question |

**Test**: Can you give a clear answer in 2-3 sentences? If yes, Puzzle-Solver may work. If the "answer" is "it's complicated," consider another archetype.

## Why This Archetype Works

Puzzle-Solver is effective when:
1. **Curiosity hook**: Readers want to know the answer
2. **Clear payoff**: The findings deliver resolution
3. **Engagement**: Active reader involvement in seeking answer
4. **Memorable**: Question-answer structure is easy to recall

**Caution**: This is the rarest archetype (5.5%) for a reason. Only use it if you have a genuine, answerable question. Forcing a question onto research that doesn't fit creates awkward abstracts.

## When NOT to Use Puzzle-Solver

Avoid this archetype when:
- Your question is rhetorical
- The answer is "it depends" or "it's complex"
- You're primarily filling a gap (use Research-Report)
- The phenomenon is more compelling than the question (use Empirical-Showcase)
- You're establishing significance first (use Stakes-Driven)
