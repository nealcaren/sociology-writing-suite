# Archetype 1: Empirical-Showcase

**Prevalence**: 35 abstracts (38.5% of corpus)

## Overview

**Definition**: Abstracts that open by describing an observable social phenomenon, then show how the study illuminates this phenomenon through interview data.

**Strategic Purpose**: Ground research in recognizable social world. Makes abstract accessible to readers beyond narrow specialization. Emphasizes empirical discovery.

## When to Use This Archetype

Use Empirical-Showcase when:
- Your phenomenon is compelling, surprising, or dramatic
- You want broad accessibility beyond your subfield
- Your discovery is the hook (not the gap or puzzle)
- Readers don't need literature context to understand why your topic matters
- The "what" is more compelling than the "why matters"

**Best for**: Articles with dramatic or timely empirical content, general audience appeal, studies where the phenomenon speaks for itself.

## Checklist

Before finalizing an Empirical-Showcase abstract, verify:

- [ ] Opening sentence describes phenomenon (not literature or stakes)
- [ ] Phenomenon is compelling/surprising/timely
- [ ] Study focus appears early (position 2-3)
- [ ] Data description includes N, population, location
- [ ] Findings occupy 2-4 sentences
- [ ] Closing states contribution explicitly
- [ ] Total: 5-9 sentences, 139-248 words
- [ ] Accessible to readers outside subfield

## Why This Archetype Works

Empirical-Showcase is effective because:
1. **Immediate engagement**: Readers connect with recognizable social phenomena
2. **Broad accessibility**: No specialized knowledge required to understand the hook
3. **Discovery emphasis**: Positions study as revealing something about the world
4. **Clear structure**: Predictable flow from phenomenon to findings to contribution

**Caution**: Don't use this archetype if your phenomenon isn't genuinely compelling. A weak phenomenon-led opening falls flat.
