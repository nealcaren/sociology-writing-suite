## Overall Benchmarks

| Metric | Min | Q25 | Median | Q75 | Max |
|--------|-----|-----|--------|-----|-----|
| **Word count** | 116 | 166 | 189 | 201 | 250 |
| **Sentence count** | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 10 |
| **Words per sentence** | ~25 | ~27 | ~29 | ~32 | ~35 |

---

## Target Ranges

Use the interquartile range (Q25-Q75) as your target. Deviations should be intentional.

### Word Count
- **Target**: 166-201 words
- **Median**: 189 words
- **Under 165 words**: May signal underdeveloped findings
- **Over 210 words**: May signal over-elaboration

### Sentence Count
- **Target**: 5-7 sentences
- **Median**: 6 sentences
- **Under 5 sentences**: May miss essential moves
- **Over 8 sentences**: May be too detailed for abstract

### Words per Sentence
- **Target**: ~29 words per sentence
- **Under 25 words**: May feel choppy
- **Over 35 words**: May need splitting

## Archetype-Specific Norms

### Empirical-Showcase (38.5%)

| Metric | Value | Range |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Word count (median) | 189 | 139-248 |
| Sentence count (median) | 6.5 | 5-9 |
| Words per sentence | 29.1 | -- |

**Key**: Standard length. Phenomenon-led opening. 2-4 findings sentences.

---

### Research-Report (42.9%)

| Metric | Value | Range |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Word count (median) | 183 | 116-250 |
| Sentence count (median) | 6.4 | 4-10 |
| Words per sentence | 28.6 | -- |

**Key**: Most flexible range. Can be very compact (116 words) or extended (250 words).

---

### Stakes-Driven (13.2%)

| Metric | Value | Range |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Word count (median) | 196 | 155-248 |
| Sentence count (median) | 7.0 | 5-10 |
| Words per sentence | 28.0 | -- |

**Key**: Longest archetype. Needs space for stakes + gap + implications.

---

### Puzzle-Solver (5.5%)

| Metric | Value | Range |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Word count (median) | 185 | 139-238 |
| Sentence count (median) | 6.6 | 4-10 |
| Words per sentence | 28.0 | -- |

**Key**: Standard length. Quick transition from question to data.

## Content Benchmarks

### Theory Mention
- **Rate**: 17% of abstracts mention a named theory or framework
- **Guidance**: Theory mention is optional, not expected
- **If included**: Brief (1-2 phrases, not extended exposition)

### Sample Size Mention
- **Rate**: 24% explicitly state sample size (N)
- **Guidance**: Including N is helpful but not universal
- **Format**: "Drawing on [N] interviews with..."

### First-Person Usage
- **Rate**: 62% of abstracts use first person
- **Forms**: "We find that...", "I argue that...", "Our results..."
- **Alternative**: "This study finds...", "Findings show..."

## Move Distribution

### Essential Moves (include in every abstract)

| Move | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| STUDY-FOCUS | 90% | What study examines |
| DATA-DESCRIBE | 87% | Interview sample |
| FINDINGS | 95% | 2-3 sentences typically |
| CLOSING | 100% | Contribution or implications |

### Optional Moves

| Move | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| GAP | ~40% | Common in Research-Report, Stakes-Driven |
| PRIOR-RESEARCH | ~30% | If not opening move |
| ARGUMENT | ~11% | Strong theoretical contribution |

---

## Closing Move Distribution

| Closing Type | Frequency |
|--------------|-----------|
| CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION | 72.5% |
| CLOSE-IMPLICATIONS | 16.5% |
| CLOSE-FINDINGS | 9.9% |
| CLOSE-GENERALIZATION | 1.1% |

**Guidance**: Default to CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION unless you have strong policy implications.

## Opening Move Distribution

| Opening Type | Frequency | Archetype |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| OPEN-PHENOMENON | 38.5% | Empirical-Showcase |
| PRIOR-RESEARCH | ~25% | Research-Report |
| OPEN-RESEARCH | ~18% | Research-Report |
| OPEN-STAKES | 13.2% | Stakes-Driven |
| OPEN-PUZZLE | 5.5% | Puzzle-Solver |

## Calibration Checklist

Before finalizing, verify your abstract against these norms:

| Metric | Your Draft | Target | Status |
|--------|------------|--------|--------|
| Word count | ___ | 166-201 | [ ] OK / [ ] Adjust |
| Sentence count | ___ | 5-7 | [ ] OK / [ ] Adjust |
| Words per sentence | ___ | ~29 | [ ] OK / [ ] Adjust |
| STUDY-FOCUS present | ___ | Yes | [ ] OK / [ ] Add |
| DATA-DESCRIBE present | ___ | Yes | [ ] OK / [ ] Add |
| FINDINGS sentences | ___ | 2-3 | [ ] OK / [ ] Adjust |
| Closing type | ___ | CONTRIBUTION | [ ] OK / [ ] Revise |

## Interpreting Deviations

| Deviation | Possible Reason | Action |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| **Under 165 words** | Underdeveloped findings | Expand findings preview |
| **Over 210 words** | Over-elaboration | Cut secondary details |
| **Under 5 sentences** | Missing essential moves | Add STUDY-FOCUS, DATA, or FINDINGS |
| **Over 8 sentences** | Too detailed | Combine or cut sentences |
| **No closing claim** | Abstract trails off | Add CLOSE-CONTRIBUTION |
| **Weak findings** | Only 1 sentence | Expand to 2-3 sentences |

## Journal-Specific Notes

*Social Problems* and *Social Forces* do not specify abstract word limits, but typical ranges are:

| Journal | Typical Range | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Social Problems | 150-250 words | Prefers informative abstracts |
| Social Forces | 150-250 words | Allows structured or unstructured |
| ASR | 150-200 words | Tighter word limits |
| AJS | 150-200 words | Tighter word limits |

**Guidance**: Target 180-200 words for maximum compatibility across journals.

## Quick Reference

### Target Abstract
- **Words**: 180-200
- **Sentences**: 6
- **Structure**: Opening -> Study Focus -> Data -> Findings (2-3) -> Contribution
- **Closing**: CONTRIBUTION with strong verb

### Acceptable Range
- **Words**: 165-210
- **Sentences**: 5-7
- **Closing**: CONTRIBUTION or IMPLICATIONS

### Red Flags
- Under 150 words (underdeveloped)
- Over 250 words (over-elaborated)
- Under 4 sentences (missing moves)
- Over 9 sentences (too detailed)
- No explicit contribution claim
