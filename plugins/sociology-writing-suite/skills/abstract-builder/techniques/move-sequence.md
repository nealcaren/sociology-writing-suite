# Move Sequence

A guide to structuring abstracts through predictable move sequences, based on analysis of 91 abstracts from *Social Problems* and *Social Forces*.

---

## Overview

Abstracts follow predictable move sequences. Understanding which moves are essential, which are optional, and where each typically appears helps you structure effective abstracts.

### Essential Moves (appear in 80%+ of abstracts)

| Move | Frequency | Function | Typical Position |
|------|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **STUDY-FOCUS** | 90% | State what study examines | 2-3 |
| **DATA-DESCRIBE** | 87% | Describe interview sample | 3-4 |
| **FINDINGS** | 95% | Preview key results | 4-6 (multiple sentences) |
| **CLOSING** | 100% | State contribution/implications | Final |

### Optional Moves (appear in 40-80% of abstracts)

| Move | Frequency | Function | When to Include |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **GAP** | ~40% | Identify limitation in knowledge | Gap-filling contributions |
| **PRIOR-RESEARCH** | ~30% | Position in literature | When not in opening |
| **ARGUMENT** | ~11% | State interpretive claim | Strong theoretical contribution |

## Move Definitions

### OPEN-[TYPE] (Position 1)

The opening move that sets the abstract's tone. See `opening-moves.md` for details.

| Type | Function | Example Start |
|------|----------|---------------|
| PHENOMENON | Describe social phenomenon | "Elites often use merit to..." |
| PRIOR-RESEARCH | Position in literature | "A robust literature has shown..." |
| RESEARCH | State study directly | "This study investigates..." |
| STAKES | Establish importance | "Women increasingly work for pay, disrupting..." |
| PUZZLE | Pose explicit question | "How does conspiracist thinking become...?" |
| GAP | State limitation | "Although X, little is known about Y..." |

---

### STUDY-FOCUS (Position 2-3)

State what the study examines, explores, or investigates.

**Template patterns**:
- "This [study/article/paper] examines [focus]."
- "This article explores [topic] through [approach]."
- "In this paper, we [verb] [focus]."
- "We examine [focus] to [purpose]."

**Examples**:
> "This study examines how mothers in doubled-up households negotiate identity and dignity."

> "We examine how people construct what it means to be an ally to marginalized groups."

> "In this paper, we draw on 71 interviews with elites in Denmark and the UK to compare self-justifications of meritocratic legitimacy."

---

### DATA-DESCRIBE (Position 3-4)

Describe your interview data: number, population, location.

**Template patterns**:
- "Drawing on [N] in-depth interviews with [population] in [location], [I/we] [verb]..."
- "Based on [N] interviews with [population], [finding preview]."
- "Using interview data with [N] [population], [I/we] find..."
- "Through [N] interviews with [population]..."

**Key elements to include**:
- Number of interviews (N)
- Population/sample description
- Location (if relevant)
- Sometimes: time period, method details

**Examples**:
> "Drawing on in-depth interviews with 67 low-income Black mothers in the Sunnyside neighborhood in Houston, Texas, I argue that..."

> "Based on 70 in-depth interviews with college students who identify as allies to one or more marginalized groups, we analyze..."

> "Drawing on interviews with 103 defrauded Stanford clients in the US and Venezuela, this article shows that..."

**Sample size mention rate**: 24% include explicit sample size in data description.

---

### GAP (Position 2-3, optional)

Identify what is missing or understudied in existing research.

**Template patterns**:
- "However, [gap in knowledge]."
- "Yet, few [studies/scholars] have [addressed X]."
- "Little [research/attention] has [examined Y]."
- "Although [X], little is known about [Y]."

**When to include**:
- Gap-filling is your primary contribution
- Research-Report archetype (61% include GAP)
- Stakes-Driven archetype (67% include GAP)

**Examples**:
> "However, little empirical research traces the mechanisms through which surveillance reproduces inequality in other domains."

> "Yet, few scholars have examined how these dynamics play out among immigrant populations."

---

### PRIOR-RESEARCH (Position 1-2)

Position study within scholarly conversation. May be opening move or follow phenomenon opener.

**Template patterns**:
- "[Scholars/Research] has shown that [finding]."
- "[Topic] has received [attention level] in [field]."
- "Research demonstrates that [pattern]."

**Examples**:
> "A robust literature has shown that surveillance disproportionately targets poor people of color."

> "Scholars underline the persistence of gender disparities in the household division of labor."

---

### FINDINGS (Position 4-6, typically 2-3 sentences)

Preview key results. This is the largest section of most abstracts.

**Template patterns**:
- "[We/I] find that [finding]."
- "Findings show that [result]."
- "Our results indicate that [finding]."
- "[We/I] argue that [claim]."

**Additional findings patterns**:
- "Moreover, [additional finding]."
- "[First group] [verb], whereas [second group] [verb]."
- "Specifically, [elaboration]."
- "Furthermore, [additional finding]."

**Typical structure**:
- First findings sentence: Primary result
- Second findings sentence: Additional result or elaboration
- Optional third: Further specification or contrast

**Examples**:
> "Our results indicate that while elites in both countries are united by a common concern to frame their merits as spontaneously recognized by others, the package of attributes they foreground vary significantly."

> "In the UK, elites tend to be 'talent meritocrats' who foreground their unique capacity for ideational creativity or risk taking. In contrast, in Denmark, elites are more likely to be 'hard work meritocrats' who emphasize their unusual work ethic."

---

### CLOSE-[TYPE] (Final Position)

The closing move that states contribution. See `closing-moves.md` for details.

| Type | Frequency | Function | Example |
|------|-----------|----------|---------|
| CONTRIBUTION | 72.5% | State what study demonstrates | "This research demonstrates that..." |
| IMPLICATIONS | 16.5% | State broader implications | "Our findings have implications for..." |
| FINDINGS | 9.9% | End with final finding | "[Final finding]" |

## Common Sequencing Errors

| Error | Problem | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Missing STUDY-FOCUS** | Readers don't know what you examined | Add explicit study focus |
| **Missing DATA-DESCRIBE** | No sense of empirical grounding | Include N, population, location |
| **Single findings sentence** | Underdeveloped results preview | Expand to 2-3 sentences |
| **No closing claim** | Abstract trails off | Add explicit contribution |
| **Opening mismatches archetype** | Confusing structure | Align opening with archetype |
| **Gap appears too late** | Weak motivation | Move gap to position 2 |

## Quick Reference: Essential Elements Checklist

Every abstract should include:

- [ ] Clear opening move (matches archetype)
- [ ] Study focus statement (what you examined)
- [ ] Data description (N, population, location)
- [ ] Findings preview (2-3 sentences)
- [ ] Closing statement (contribution or implications)
