## 1. OPEN-PHENOMENON (38.5%)

Describe an observable social phenomenon that grounds your research.

### When to Use
- Your phenomenon is compelling, surprising, or dramatic
- Readers don't need literature context to understand relevance
- You want broad accessibility
- Discovery is your hook

### Template Patterns

**Pattern A: [Group/phenomenon] [verb describing pattern]**
> "[Group] often/typically/increasingly [verb] [description]."

**Pattern B: [Event/condition] has [consequence]**
> "[Event] has [consequence] for [population]."

**Pattern C: [Social condition] characterizes [context]**
> "[Condition] characterizes [setting/population]."

### Examples from Corpus

> "Elites often use merit to explain, justify, and make sense of their advantaged positions."

> "The Stanford Financial Group's 2009 collapse devastated more than 20,000 depositors across the Americas."

> "Racial disparities in police-community encounters are well documented, with people of color experiencing higher levels of police scrutiny."

> "Ghostwriters represent a form of labor aimed at producing someone else's self, or what we label 'stand-in labor.'"

> "Former President Trump's election and subsequent anti-immigrant policy initiatives brought an unprecedented sense of uncertainty for undocumented immigrants."

## 2. PRIOR-RESEARCH (~25%)

Position study within scholarly conversation by referencing what scholars know.

### When to Use
- Your audience is specialists in your subfield
- You're filling a gap in literature
- Positioning matters more than phenomenon description
- Efficiency and directness are valued

### Template Patterns

**Pattern A: [Scholars/Research] [verb] that...**
> "[Scholars/Research/A robust literature] has shown that [finding]."

**Pattern B: Research on [topic] demonstrates...**
> "Research on [topic] demonstrates that [pattern]."

### Examples from Corpus

> "A robust literature has shown that surveillance disproportionately targets poor people of color through the criminal justice and welfare systems."

> "Scholars underline the persistence of gender disparities in the household division of labor."

> "Research demonstrates that diaspora movements play a powerful role in contentious politics and social change in their homelands under a range of conditions."

> "Scholars have long demonstrated that Latinx children engage in cultural and linguistic brokering on behalf of their immigrant parents."

## 3. OPEN-RESEARCH (~18%)

State what the study does directly, without literature preamble.

### When to Use
- You want maximum efficiency
- The study's focus is the hook
- Contribution is clear from the topic itself
- Word count is tight

### Template Patterns

**Pattern A: This study [verb] [topic]**
> "This study [investigates/examines/explores] [focus]."

**Pattern B: This study of [topic] contributes...**
> "This study of [topic] contributes [type] to [field]."

### Examples from Corpus

> "This study investigates the social incorporation of unaccompanied, undocumented Latinx youth workers as they come of age in the United States."

> "This study of refugee resettlement contributes a novel conceptual framework to the sociology of forced migration."

## 4. OPEN-STAKES (13.2%)

Establish why the topic matters by foregrounding importance, urgency, or change.

### When to Use
- You need to justify why your topic is important
- Policy relevance is central
- Social change or disruption frames your work
- Readers need to know "why this matters" first

### Template Patterns

**Pattern A: [Group/phenomenon] increasingly/currently [verb]**
> "[Group] [increasingly/currently] [verb], [consequence]."

**Pattern B: [Topic] is [important/critical/central]**
> "[Topic] is [important/critical/central] [because/as...]."

**Pattern C: With the [expansion/change] of [trend]...**
> "With the [expansion/growth/change] of [trend], [consequence]."

### Examples from Corpus

> "Women increasingly work for pay, disrupting cultural expectations and relational dynamics tied to men's breadwinning."

> "Many professional labor markets are currently experiencing signs of deprofessionalization, including automation of tasks and increasingly unstable employment conditions."

> "Neighborhoods are an important social context for children's development; however, a growing body of research illustrates that there is often significant heterogeneity..."

> "With the expansion of state surveillance and enforcement efforts in recent decades, a growing literature examines how those vulnerable to punitive state contact strategize to evade it."

> "Private landlords play an important role in America's poverty governance, with profound effects on poor families and neighborhoods."

## 5. OPEN-PUZZLE (5.5%)

Pose an explicit question that the study answers.

### When to Use
- You have a specific, answerable question
- Curiosity is your hook
- Problem-solution structure fits
- Your study definitively answers something

### Template Patterns

**Pattern A: How does [X] [verb]?**
> "How does [X] [verb] [consequence]?"

**Pattern B: How do [actors] [verb]?**
> "How do [actors] [verb] [action]?"

**Pattern C: What happens when [condition]?**
> "What [happens/explains] when [condition]?"

**Pattern D: [Context], [question]?**
> "[Context sentence]. [How/What] [question]?"

### Examples from Corpus

> "How does conspiracist thinking become appealing to its adherents, and with what political consequences?"

> "How do real-estate investors make decisions about where to purchase properties?"

> "How does the victimization of women's bodies in medical interactions contribute to their experience of gendered violence?"

> "Middle-class households typically search for housing with an eye to long-term residence and are able to maintain a high level of stability, but what happens when these households are forced to make mobility decisions after exposure to a disaster and subsequent residential displacement?"

## 6. OPEN-GAP (Variant of Research-Report)

Open directly with the limitation in existing knowledge.

### When to Use
- The gap itself is compelling
- You want to foreground what's missing
- Gap-filling is your primary contribution

### Template Patterns

**Pattern: Although/Despite X, [gap]**
> "Although [established finding], little [research/attention] has [examined Y]."
> "Despite [condition], relatively little is known about [gap]."

### Examples from Corpus

> "Although family and migration scholars recognize that intimate partner violence (IPV) can motivate women's movement between countries, little research considers IPV or other gendered family violence further back in women migrants' life histories..."

> "Despite the ubiquitous nature of racist and sexist discourses online, and evidence that racism and sexism are built into the architecture of online spaces, relatively little is known about how people respond to online inequalities."

| If you want to... | Use... | Example start |
|-------------------|--------|---------------|
| Ground in social world | OPEN-PHENOMENON | "Elites often use merit to..." |
| Position in literature | PRIOR-RESEARCH | "A robust literature has shown..." |
| State study directly | OPEN-RESEARCH | "This study investigates..." |
| Establish importance | OPEN-STAKES | "Women increasingly work for pay, disrupting..." |
| Hook with curiosity | OPEN-PUZZLE | "How does conspiracist thinking become appealing...?" |
| Foreground the gap | OPEN-GAP | "Although scholars recognize X, little is known about Y..." |

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Mismatching Opening and Archetype
The opening must match your chosen archetype. A phenomenon opener with Research-Report structure confuses readers.

### 2. Weak Phenomenon Openings
"Many people experience X" is weak. "Elites use merit to justify their positions" is strong. Be specific.

### 3. Generic Stakes
"This topic is important" is weak. "Women increasingly work for pay, disrupting cultural expectations" is strong. Show the disruption.

### 4. Rhetorical Questions
"What does this mean?" is weak. "How does conspiracist thinking become appealing?" is strong. The question must be genuine and answerable.

### 5. Buried Opening
Don't hide your opening move in subordinate clauses. Lead with the key information.
