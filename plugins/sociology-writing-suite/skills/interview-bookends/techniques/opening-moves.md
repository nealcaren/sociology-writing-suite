# Opening Move Types

This guide details the five types of opening moves used in sociology interview article introductions, with frequencies from genre analysis.

## Overview

| Opening Move | Frequency | Best For |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Phenomenon-led | 74% | Gap-Filler, Concept-Building, Synthesis |
| Stakes-led | 11% | Problem-Driven, Gap-Filler |
| Case-led | 8% | Problem-Driven, Synthesis |
| Theory-led | 6% | Theory-Extension |
| Question-led | 1% | Rare; use sparingly |

## 1. Phenomenon-Led Opening (74%)

Opens with an empirical statement about the world. The most common approach.

### What It Does
- Grounds the article in observable reality
- Establishes the phenomenon before the puzzle
- Shows rather than tells
- Signals empirical focus

### Structure
1. State the phenomenon
2. Provide context/prevalence
3. Move toward the puzzle

### Examples

**Simple statement**:
> "Neighborhood is an important theme in research on prisoner reentry and desistance from offending, but scholars and practitioners typically use this to refer to a single location."

**Statistical grounding**:
> "Between 50 and 67 percent of U.S. households have a pet."

**Population focus**:
> "Tasked with protecting children from abuse and neglect, U.S. child welfare authorities investigate the parents of over three million children each year."

**Trend statement**:
> "The self-contained, self-reliant nuclear family persists as the archetypal family form, despite its declining prevalence."

### When to Use
- Default choice for most articles
- When the phenomenon itself is inherently interesting
- When you want to establish empirical grounding before theory
- When readers need to see the puzzle in the world before the literature

### When to Avoid
- When the framework IS the contribution (use theory-led)
- When stakes need immediate emphasis (use stakes-led)

## 2. Stakes-Led Opening (11%)

Opens with an importance claim about why the topic matters.

### What It Does
- Creates immediate urgency
- Signals policy relevance
- Engages readers who care about real-world impact
- Establishes significance before details

### Structure
1. State why this matters
2. Contextualize the stakes
3. Move to specific focus

### Examples

**Scale emphasis**:
> "The unprecedented growth in rates of U.S. incarceration since the early 1970s has prompted scholars to rethink basic understandings of punishment, inequality, and the state."

**Policy urgency**:
> "As global unaccompanied minor migration persists and expands, understanding how these youth navigate incorporation has never been more urgent."

**Social significance**:
> "Decades of research have made the case that neighborhoods are important contexts for children's development, shaping their educational achievement, health, and life chances."

### When to Use
- Problem-Driven articles with policy implications
- When the "so what?" needs emphasis
- When reader motivation might flag without urgency
- When connecting to current events or policy debates

### When to Avoid
- When stakes feel manufactured or overblown
- When the phenomenon should speak for itself
- When you risk seeming self-important

## 3. Case-Led Opening (8%)

Opens with a concrete case, scene, or vignette.

### What It Does
- Creates narrative engagement
- Grounds abstractions in specifics
- Signals qualitative, context-rich approach
- Makes the phenomenon vivid

### Structure
1. Describe specific case/scene
2. Zoom out to broader pattern
3. Move to puzzle/question

### Examples

**Policy case**:
> "In Cleveland, Ohio, the federal Department of Justice declared that the city's police department engaged in a 'pattern or practice' of using excessive force."

**Historical moment**:
> "On Tuesday, November 27, 2018, President Emmanuel Macron stood outside of the Elysee Palace delivering a speech on 'ecological transition.'"

**Composite vignette**:
> "When Maria arrived at the welfare office, she knew the routine: arrive early, bring all documents, expect to wait."

### When to Use
- Problem-Driven articles grounded in specific context
- When the case IS the entry point to broader analysis
- When narrative engagement matters
- When the case exemplifies the puzzle

### When to Avoid
- When the case might seem idiosyncratic
- When you can't connect it to broader patterns
- When abstractions need emphasis over particulars

## 4. Theory-Led Opening (6%)

Opens with a theoretical framework or concept.

### What It Does
- Signals theoretical contribution
- Establishes framework before application
- Appeals to theory-oriented readers
- Centers the framework as the article's backbone

### Structure
1. Introduce the framework/concept
2. Explain its utility
3. Set up the extension or application

### Examples

**Named concept**:
> "The concept of the 'glass cliff' refers to the tendency for women and racial/ethnic minorities to be appointed to leadership positions during times of crisis."

**Theoretical tradition**:
> "Recognition theory suggests that social identities are shaped through intersubjective processes of acknowledgment and validation."

**Framework introduction**:
> "Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital has proven remarkably productive for understanding educational inequality."

### When to Use
- Theory-Extension articles (30% of this cluster uses it)
- When the framework is well-known and central
- When the contribution IS applying the framework
- When readers expect theoretical framing

### When to Avoid
- When the framework is obscure (define later)
- When empirical grounding is needed first
- When the phenomenon is more compelling than the theory

## 5. Question-Led Opening (1%)

Opens with a direct question.

### What It Does
- Poses the puzzle immediately
- Signals inquiry-driven approach
- Can create engagement if question is compelling
- Mirrors how research actually begins

### Structure
1. Ask the question
2. Explain why it matters
3. Preview the answer

### Examples

**Paradox question**:
> "How do people make sense of their reliance on unjust institutions?"

**Process question**:
> "What happens when social movement organizations must choose between their ideals and their survival?"

**Puzzle question**:
> "Why do residents of high-crime neighborhoods call the police despite widespread distrust?"

### Why It's Rare (1%)
- Can feel rhetorically performative
- Implies the answer is unknown (requires justification)
- "Showing" is usually more persuasive than "asking"
- Questions can feel like a gimmick

### When to Use
- When the question is genuinely compelling
- When the paradox is the central puzzle
- When the question format captures something assertions don't
- Synthesis articles where the question bridges literatures

### When to Avoid
- As a default (it's overused in student writing)
- When the question isn't actually puzzling
- When showing would be more effective than asking

## Choosing Your Opening Move

### Decision Tree

1. **Is the framework central to contribution?**
   - Yes → Consider Theory-Led
   - No → Continue

2. **Is there immediate policy/social urgency?**
   - Yes → Consider Stakes-Led
   - No → Continue

3. **Is a specific case the entry point?**
   - Yes → Consider Case-Led
   - No → Continue

4. **Is the phenomenon inherently interesting?**
   - Yes → Use Phenomenon-Led (default)
   - Uncertain → Use Phenomenon-Led

5. **Is there a genuinely compelling paradox?**
   - Yes → Consider Question-Led (rare)
   - No → Don't force it
