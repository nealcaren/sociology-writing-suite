# Cluster 2: Theory-Extension Framework Applier

**Prevalence**: 22.5% of corpus

**Contribution logic**: "Framework X exists; I show it applies to Y."

---

## Identifying Theory-Extension Articles

Your article is Theory-Extension if:
- The Theory section **applies an established framework** to a new domain
- You **name a specific framework** (often by author: "Bourdieu's...", "Goffman's...")
- The contribution is **demonstrating the framework's utility** in a new context
- Subsections are **light to moderate** (1-4)
- Literature balance is **theory-heavy**

## Introduction Signature

### Key Statistics
| Feature | Typical Value |
|---------|---------------|
| Word count | 750-900 words |
| Paragraphs | 5-7 |
| Opening move | Theory-led (30%) or Phenomenon-led (50%) |
| Data mention | Late (after framework established) |
| Roadmap | 40% |

### Opening Move
**Theory-led openings are distinctive** to this cluster (30% vs. 6% corpus average):

> "The concept of the 'glass cliff' refers to the tendency for women and racial/ethnic minorities to be appointed to leadership positions during times of crisis."

But **phenomenon-led is still common** (50%):

> "As discrimination in labor markets persists, scholars have sought to understand how disadvantaged groups navigate occupational barriers."

### When to Use Theory-Led
Use theory-led opening when:
- The framework is **well-known** in the field
- The framework IS the backbone of the article
- Readers will recognize the framework immediately

Use phenomenon-led when:
- The phenomenon needs establishing before the framework
- You want to show the puzzle first, then introduce the framework as a tool

### Structure
1. **Opening** (1-2 sentences): Framework or phenomenon
2. **Framework exposition** (1-2 paragraphs): Explain the framework
3. **Extension gap** (1 paragraph): Why it hasn't been applied to this domain
4. **Why extension matters** (1 paragraph): What we expect to learn
5. **Data preview** (2-3 sentences): Can be late
6. **Argument preview** (3-4 sentences): Framework + domain = insight

### The Extension Move
The key rhetorical move is showing why extension is **non-trivial**:

> "While [framework] has illuminated [domain A], scholars have not applied it to [domain B]. This is surprising because [reasons it might operate differently]. We extend [framework] to [domain B] to reveal [insight]."

## Conclusion Signature

### Key Statistics
| Feature | Typical Value |
|---------|---------------|
| Word count | 1,000-1,200 words |
| Paragraphs | 6-8 |
| Intro:Conclusion ratio | ~1.41x |
| Limitations | Present (60%) |
| Future directions | Present (70%) |

### Core Function
The conclusion must **affirm framework utility**:

> "These findings demonstrate the utility of [framework] for understanding [new domain]. The framework illuminated [specific insight] that prior approaches missed."

### Structure
1. **Restatement opening** (1 paragraph): Return to framework + domain
2. **Framework affirmation** (1-2 paragraphs): Show the framework worked
3. **What extension revealed** (1-2 paragraphs): Insights unique to this domain
4. **Contribution claim** (1 paragraph): What we now know about framework AND domain
5. **Limitations** (1 paragraph)
6. **Future extensions** (1 paragraph): Other domains where framework might apply
7. **Coda** (2-3 sentences)

### Affirming the Framework
The conclusion must show the framework **did analytic work**:

**Not this**:
> "We applied [framework] to [domain]."

**This**:
> "[Framework] revealed [insight] that other approaches could not capture. Specifically, the concept of [X] illuminated [Y], demonstrating the framework's utility beyond its original domain."

### Suggesting Further Extensions
Theory-Extension conclusions often point to **other potential applications**:

> "These findings suggest [framework] may prove useful for understanding [other domain]. Future research might examine whether [mechanism] operates similarly in [other context]."

## Coherence Pattern

### Dominant Type
**Parallel (60%)** and **Escalators (20%)**

### Deflation Risk
**Moderate (10%)**: Frameworks don't always work as expected in new domains.

**Warning signs**:
- Findings don't clearly connect to framework concepts
- Framework feels "tacked on" rather than central
- Extension reveals the framework doesn't quite fit

### Avoiding Deflation
1. **Choose the right framework**: If the framework doesn't fit, reconsider
2. **Show conceptual connection**: Link findings to framework vocabulary
3. **Acknowledge if framework needed modification**: This can BE the contribution

### Escalation
Framework may prove **more useful than expected** (20%):

> "Beyond confirming [framework]'s utility, our findings suggest [additional insight], extending [framework] in [new direction]."

## Writing Checklist

### Introduction
- [ ] Consider theory-led opening if framework is well-known
- [ ] Name the framework explicitly
- [ ] Explain framework enough for readers to follow
- [ ] Show why extension to this domain is non-trivial
- [ ] Establish what we expect to learn
- [ ] Data can come late (after framework)

### Conclusion
- [ ] Plan for moderate length (~1,000-1,200 words)
- [ ] Open with restatement of framework + domain
- [ ] Affirm framework utility explicitly
- [ ] Show what extension revealed
- [ ] Connect findings to framework vocabulary
- [ ] Point to other potential applications
- [ ] Include limitations

### Coherence
- [ ] Framework appears in both intro and conclusion
- [ ] Framework concepts appear in findings
- [ ] Extension is demonstrated, not just claimed
- [ ] No deflation—framework must do work
- [ ] Vocabulary from framework recurs throughout
