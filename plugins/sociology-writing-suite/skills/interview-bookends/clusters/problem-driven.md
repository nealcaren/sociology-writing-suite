# Cluster 5: Problem-Driven Pragmatist

**Prevalence**: 15.0% of corpus

**Contribution logic**: "Here's an important problem; here's what my research reveals about it."

---

## Identifying Problem-Driven Articles

Your article is Problem-Driven if:
- The Theory section is organized around **empirical puzzles or policy debates**
- Theory enters **in service of the problem** (not leading)
- Structure may be **problem-response or dialogue**
- Literature balance is **balanced or substantive-heavy**
- The contribution is primarily **empirical documentation** or **debate resolution**

### Two Sub-Types

**5a: Debate-Resolvers**
- Frame existing literature as characterized by competing positions
- Position study as resolving the tension
- "Scholars disagree about X; our data adjudicates"

**5b: Empirical Documenters**
- Heavy on descriptive context with light theoretical framing
- Often policy-relevant research
- "Here's what's happening with [understudied phenomenon]"

## Introduction Signature

### Key Statistics
| Feature | Typical Value |
|---------|---------------|
| Word count | 750-950 words |
| Paragraphs | 5-7 |
| Opening move | Phenomenon (50%), Stakes (25%), Case (17%) |
| Data mention | Early to middle |
| Roadmap | Lower (33%) |

### Opening Move
**Stakes-led openings are common** (25% vs. 11% corpus average):

> "As global unaccompanied minor migration persists and expands, understanding how these youth navigate incorporation has never been more urgent."

**Case-led openings work well** (17%):

> "In Cleveland, Ohio, the federal Department of Justice declared that the city's police department engaged in a 'pattern or practice' of using excessive force."

### Structure
1. **Opening** (1-2 sentences): Stakes or case
2. **Problem context** (1-2 paragraphs): Policy background, empirical stakes
3. **Theoretical positioning** (1 paragraph): Light framing, debate if applicable
4. **Research questions** (2-3 sentences): What this study examines
5. **Data preview** (2-3 sentences): Can be early
6. **Argument preview** (3-4 sentences): Main findings

### Stakes Emphasis
Problem-Driven articles emphasize **why this matters in the real world**:

> "The stakes are high: [statistic]. Understanding [phenomenon] has implications for [policy/practice]."

### Debate Framing (5a)
If debate-resolving, frame the competing positions:

> "Scholars disagree about whether [position A] or [position B] better explains [phenomenon]. Some argue [A], while others contend [B]. This study provides evidence to adjudicate this debate."

### Lower Roadmap Rate
Problem-Driven articles have lower roadmap rates (33%). The structure is often simpler—problem → evidence → implications.

## Conclusion Signature

### Key Statistics
| Feature | Typical Value |
|---------|---------------|
| Word count | 1,100-1,400 words |
| Paragraphs | 6-9 |
| Intro:Conclusion ratio | ~1.38x |
| Opening move | Integration (25%)—higher than average |
| Limitations | Present (58%)—lower |
| Future directions | Present (67%) |

### Why Integration Opening
Problem-Driven conclusions often open with **literature integration** (25%):

> "Scholarship on [topic] has not fully captured [phenomenon]. Our analysis reveals..."

### Structure
1. **Opening** (1 paragraph): Contribution claim or integration
2. **Findings summary** (1-2 paragraphs): Key empirical patterns
3. **Policy implications** (1-2 paragraphs): What this means for practice
4. **Theoretical implications** (1 paragraph): If applicable
5. **Limitations** (1 paragraph): Often brief
6. **Future directions** (1 paragraph)
7. **Coda** (2-3 sentences): Return to stakes

### Policy Implications
Problem-Driven conclusions often develop **policy implications** more extensively:

> "For practitioners, these findings suggest [recommendation]. Current policies that [X] may inadvertently [Y]. More broadly, [implication for policy domain]."

### Escalation Common
Problem-Driven articles frequently escalate (33%)—extending from specific problem to broader implications:

> "While our study focused on [specific context], these dynamics likely operate wherever [conditions]. The concept of [X] may prove useful for understanding [broader phenomenon]."

---

## Coherence Pattern

### Dominant Type
**Parallel (50%)** and **Escalators (33%)**

### Escalation Rate
**Highest (33%)**: Problem-driven research naturally extends to implications.

This is **acceptable and expected**. Real-world problems invite broader claims:

> "Understanding [phenomenon] becomes increasingly urgent as [trend] reshapes [domain]."

### Deflation Risk
**Moderate (17%)**: Can occur when policy complexity prevents full resolution.

### No Bookends
**Zero (0%)**: Problem-Driven articles don't have strong mirror structure. They move from problem to implications rather than circling back.

## Writing Checklist

### Introduction
- [ ] Consider stakes-led or case-led opening
- [ ] Emphasize policy context and real-world urgency
- [ ] If debate-resolving, frame competing positions
- [ ] Data can be mentioned early
- [ ] Roadmap optional (structure often simpler)
- [ ] Connect to current events/policy debates if relevant

### Conclusion
- [ ] Plan for moderate length (~1,100-1,400 words)
- [ ] Consider integration opening
- [ ] Develop policy implications substantively
- [ ] Connect to broader significance
- [ ] Escalation is acceptable and expected
- [ ] Return to stakes in coda
- [ ] Limitations can be brief

### Coherence
- [ ] Stakes emphasis consistent across sections
- [ ] Policy implications developed (not just mentioned)
- [ ] Escalation is grounded in evidence
- [ ] Callback to opening stakes/case
- [ ] Problem is addressed, not just described
