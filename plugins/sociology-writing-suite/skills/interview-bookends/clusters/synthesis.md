# Cluster 4: Synthesis Integrator

**Prevalence**: 17.5% of corpus

**Contribution logic**: "These literatures have developed separately; I connect them."

---

## Identifying Synthesis Articles

Your article is Synthesis if:
- The Theory section **connects previously separate literatures**
- You explicitly **name multiple theoretical traditions**
- Structure is **building-blocks or dialogue**
- Language includes "drawing together," "connecting," "integrating"
- The contribution is **integration** rather than new concept or gap-filling

## Introduction Signature

### Key Statistics
| Feature | Typical Value |
|---------|---------------|
| Word count | 800-950 words |
| Paragraphs | 6-8 |
| Opening move | Phenomenon-led (71%) |
| Data mention | Variable |
| Roadmap | 43% |

### Opening Move
**Phenomenon-led is typical** (71%), but the phenomenon sets up the integration:

> "How do people make sense of their reliance on unjust institutions?"

The opening question or phenomenon must require **multiple literatures** to answer.

### Structure
1. **Opening** (1-2 sentences): Phenomenon or question
2. **First tradition** (1 paragraph): Name and briefly describe tradition A
3. **Second tradition** (1 paragraph): Name and briefly describe tradition B
4. **Integration preview** (1 paragraph): How bringing them together illuminates
5. **Data preview** (2-3 sentences)
6. **Argument preview** (3-4 sentences): What the integration reveals

### Naming Multiple Traditions
The introduction **must name multiple traditions explicitly**:

> "To develop this analysis, we explicitly connect several theoretical traditions: recognition theory (Honneth, Lamont), legal cynicism (Kirk, Matsuda), and legal consciousness (Ewick, Silbey)."

This is not optional. Synthesis articles announce their integration upfront.

### Previewing the Integration
Show what the integration accomplishes:

> "By connecting [A] and [B], we reveal [insight]. What appeared as [separate phenomena] are better understood as [unified process]."

## Conclusion Signature

### Key Statistics
| Feature | Typical Value |
|---------|---------------|
| Word count | 1,200-1,500 words |
| Paragraphs | 7-9 |
| Intro:Conclusion ratio | ~1.69x |
| Opening move | Integration (21%)—higher than average |
| Limitations | Present (71%) |
| Future directions | Present (79%) |

### Why Integration Opening
Synthesis conclusions often open with **literature positioning** (21% vs. 9% corpus average):

> "Recent research in cultural and political sociology has emphasized the role of recognition in shaping institutional trust..."

This signals: we promised integration, and here's how we delivered.

### Structure
1. **Integration opening** (1 paragraph): Position in literature
2. **Findings summary** (1-2 paragraphs): Recap through integrative lens
3. **Tradition-by-tradition** (1-2 paragraphs): Return to each named tradition
4. **Contribution claim** (1 paragraph): What integration adds
5. **Limitations** (1 paragraph)
6. **Implications** (1 paragraph)
7. **Future directions** (1 paragraph)
8. **Coda** (2-3 sentences)

### Returning to Each Tradition
The conclusion **must return to each tradition named in the introduction**:

> "For scholars of [tradition A], our findings suggest... For researchers in [tradition B], the analysis reveals..."

If you named three traditions in the introduction, all three must appear in the conclusion.

## Coherence Pattern

### Dominant Type
**Parallel (57%)** and **Escalators (29%)**

### Deflation Risk
**Zero (0%)**: Synthesis articles never deflate.

**Why?** Integration promises are **visible and verifiable**. Either the literatures are connected or they're not. There's no graceful retreat from "I will integrate A and B" if you only deliver A.

### Escalation Opportunity
Synthesis articles often escalate (29%)—synthesis reveals additional connections beyond what was promised:

> "Beyond connecting [A] and [B], our analysis suggests a deeper affinity with [C]..."

## Exemplar

**10.1093_socpro_spaa017 (Recognition and Legal Cynicism)**

- **Introduction**: 1,010 words, question-led, three traditions named
- **Theory section**: Building-blocks arc, theory-heavy
- **Conclusion**: 2,606 words (!), integrates all traditions
- **Ratio**: 2.58
- **Coherence**: Bookends—question posed, answer delivered through integration

---

## Critical Requirements

### The Three-Tradition Rule
If you name three traditions in the introduction, your conclusion must:
1. Reference all three
2. Show how findings relate to each
3. Demonstrate the integration

### No Dropping Traditions
You cannot promise A + B + C and deliver only A + B. This is deflation.

### Integration, Not Summary
The conclusion integrates—it doesn't just summarize:

**Not this**:
> "We examined [A] and [B]."

**This**:
> "By connecting [A] and [B], we revealed [insight]. Scholars of [A] have emphasized [X]; our analysis shows that [B] complicates this by [Y]."

## Writing Checklist

### Introduction
- [ ] Name multiple traditions explicitly
- [ ] Use "connecting," "drawing together," "integrating" language
- [ ] Preview what integration accomplishes
- [ ] Establish why traditions need connecting (they've developed separately)
- [ ] Make promises you can keep

### Conclusion
- [ ] Plan for substantial length (~1,200-1,500 words)
- [ ] Consider integration opening move
- [ ] Return to EACH tradition named in introduction
- [ ] Show how findings speak to each tradition
- [ ] Demonstrate integration, not just summary
- [ ] State contribution clearly

### Coherence
- [ ] Every tradition named in intro appears in conclusion
- [ ] Integration is visible and verifiable
- [ ] No deflation—cannot drop traditions
- [ ] Vocabulary echoes: tradition names must recur
- [ ] Consider escalation if synthesis reveals more than promised
