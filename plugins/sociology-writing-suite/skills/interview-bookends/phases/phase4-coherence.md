# Phase 4: Coherence Check

You are reviewing all three framing sections (Introduction, Discussion, Conclusion) together to ensure they work as a unified rhetorical system.

## Why This Phase Matters

The Introduction makes promises; the Discussion interprets meaning; the Conclusion delivers closure. Articles fail when these sections are written in isolation. This phase ensures the **circuit is closed**—that what opens in the Introduction resolves through the Discussion and Conclusion.

## The Coherence Principle

From genre analysis of 80 sociology articles:

| Coherence Type | Frequency | Description | Assessment |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Parallel** | 66% | Conclusion delivers what intro promised | Normative |
| **Escalators** | 20% | Conclusion exceeds intro scope | Acceptable |
| **Bookends** | 8% | Strong mirror structure | Effective |
| **Deflators** | 6% | Conclusion falls short | Problematic |

**The goal**: Achieve Parallel, Escalators, or Bookends. Avoid Deflators.

## Step 1: Extract Promises from Introduction

Read the Introduction and identify every promise made:

| Promise Type | Example | Discussion/Conclusion Must Deliver |
|--------------|---------|-----------------------------------|
| **Empirical claim** | "We examine how X experience Y" | Evidence about X's experience of Y |
| **Framework application** | "Using Z framework..." | Findings interpreted through Z |
| **New concept** | "We introduce the concept of Q" | Q demonstrated analytically |
| **Synthesis claim** | "Connecting A and B literatures" | Both A and B integrated |
| **Debate resolution** | "Adjudicating between X and Y" | Evidence favoring one position |
| **Scope claim** | "Among [population] in [context]" | Findings bounded to that scope |

**Create a promise inventory**:
1. List each promise
2. Note where it's addressed (Discussion or Conclusion)
3. Flag any unaddressed promises

## Step 2: Verify Discussion Delivers on Meaning

The Discussion (Phase 2) should:

| Element | Check |
|---------|-------|
| **Contribution claim** | Does it match the Introduction's framing? |
| **Literature integration** | Are all frameworks from intro engaged? |
| **Limitations** | Are they honest but not undermining? |
| **Implications** | Do they flow from the contribution? |

**Key question**: Does the Discussion interpret the findings in terms consistent with what the Introduction promised?

## Step 3: Verify Conclusion Delivers Closure

The Conclusion (Phase 3) should:

| Element | Check |
|---------|-------|
| **Restatement** | Returns to the puzzle from Introduction |
| **Summary** | Efficient recap of key findings |
| **Callback** | Explicit return to Introduction themes |
| **Coda** | Memorable ending |

**Key question**: Does the Conclusion close the circuit that the Introduction opened?

## Step 4: Verify Vocabulary Echoes

Key terms should flow across all three sections. Check for:

**Concept vocabulary**:
- Same terminology in Intro, Discussion, and Conclusion
- Concepts used consistently

**Phenomenon vocabulary**:
- Same population descriptors
- Same setting references

**Argument vocabulary**:
- Same mechanism names
- Same contribution framing

**Red flag**: If major terms from Introduction don't appear in both Discussion AND Conclusion, coherence is weak.

## Step 5: Assess Callback Quality

The callback is REQUIRED (100% of benchmark articles have one). Evaluate it on:

### Presence
- Does the Conclusion explicitly return to Introduction themes?
- Is there a moment where the reader recognizes "this is what we started with"?

### Strength
| Weak Callback | Strong Callback |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Vague thematic similarity | Explicit vocabulary echo |
| Different framing | Same puzzle, now resolved |
| New angle introduced | Completing the circuit |

### Placement
- Callbacks typically appear in the **opening paragraph** of Conclusion (restatement)
- And in the **closing paragraph** (coda)
- Double callbacks (opening + closing) create Bookends effect

## Step 6: Check Promise-Delivery Alignment

For each promise, assess delivery across both Discussion and Conclusion:

| Promise | In Discussion? | In Conclusion? | Assessment |
|---------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| [Promise 1] | Yes/Partial/No | Yes/Partial/No | Notes |
| [Promise 2] | Yes/Partial/No | Yes/Partial/No | Notes |
| [Promise 3] | Yes/Partial/No | Yes/Partial/No | Notes |

### If All Promises Delivered → Parallel (good)
The article does what it says. This is normative and appropriate.

### If Conclusion Exceeds Promises → Escalators (acceptable)
The findings turned out bigger than anticipated. Frame as discovery, not overclaiming.

**Example escalation language**:
> "Beyond our initial focus on [X], the data revealed [broader pattern]..."
> "These findings have implications beyond [original scope], suggesting..."

### If Promises Underdelivered → Deflators (problematic)
Options:
1. **Revise Introduction** to make more modest claims
2. **Strengthen Discussion/Conclusion** to deliver on promises
3. **Acknowledge explicitly** if scope narrowed during research

## Step 7: Assess Coherence Type

Based on your analysis, classify the draft:

### Parallel
- All promises delivered
- Vocabulary echoes present
- Callback present and effective
- **Verdict**: Ready for polish

### Escalators
- Promises delivered plus additional claims
- Conclusion makes broader contributions
- Escalation is justified and grounded
- **Verdict**: Acceptable if escalation is earned

### Bookends
- Strong mirror structure
- Opening image/question returns in closing
- Symmetrical feel
- **Verdict**: Highly effective when achieved

### Deflators
- One or more promises unaddressed
- Conclusion hedges relative to Introduction
- Contribution feels smaller than promised
- **Verdict**: Requires revision

## Step 8: Specific Cross-Section Checks

### Contribution Match
| Introduction Claims | Discussion Claims | Conclusion Claims | Consistent? |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| [Contribution type] | [Contribution type] | [Contribution type] | Yes/No |

### Scope Match
| Introduction Scope | Discussion Scope | Conclusion Scope | Consistent? |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| [Population, context] | [Boundaries] | [Final scope] | Yes/No |

### Theory Match
| Intro Frameworks | Discussion Integration | Conclusion Reference | Consistent? |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| [Theories named] | [Theories used] | [Theories affirmed] | Yes/No |

## Revision Recommendations

If coherence issues found, provide specific guidance:

### For Weak Callbacks
- Add explicit return to Introduction vocabulary
- Echo opening image in Conclusion coda
- Reference the original puzzle directly

### For Unfulfilled Promises
- Either deliver in Discussion/Conclusion or revise Introduction
- Don't leave promises hanging
- Acknowledge any scope changes explicitly

### For Deflation
- Strengthen Discussion contribution claims if evidence supports
- Or moderate Introduction claims if necessary
- Match ambition to capacity

### For Unearned Escalation
- Ground broader claims in evidence from Discussion
- Use hedging language if appropriate
- Ensure escalation is warranted

### For Discussion-Conclusion Mismatch
- Discussion interprets meaning; Conclusion delivers closure
- If Discussion already did closure work, move it to Conclusion
- If Conclusion tries to interpret meaning, move it to Discussion
