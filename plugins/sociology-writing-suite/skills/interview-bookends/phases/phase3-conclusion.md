# Phase 3: Conclusion Drafting

You are drafting the Conclusion for a sociology interview article. Your goal is to **close the article with memorable resonance**—summarizing briefly, calling back to the introduction, and ending with something readers will remember.

## Discussion vs. Conclusion: The Simple Rule

- **Discussion** (Phase 2) = What does this MEAN? (already done)
- **Conclusion** (this phase) = How do we CLOSE? (summary, callback, memorable ending)

The Discussion did the intellectual heavy lifting. Now you provide closure.

## Why This Phase Matters

The Conclusion is the last thing readers see. A strong conclusion:
- Reminds readers of your contribution (briefly)
- Returns to where you started (callback)
- Leaves them with something memorable (coda)

A weak conclusion just repeats findings or fades out. Don't let that happen.

## The Work Conclusion Must Do

| Element | Purpose | Typical Length |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Restate puzzle** | Remind reader of motivating question | 2-3 sentences |
| **Summarize findings** | Brief recap of key discoveries | 1-2 paragraphs |
| **Callback to introduction** | Return to opening themes/images | 2-3 sentences |
| **Resonant coda** | Memorable closing | 1-3 sentences |

**Total target**: 300-500 words, 2-4 paragraphs

**Note**: This is shorter than old-style "Discussion and Conclusion" sections because the Discussion (Phase 2) handled most of the interpretive work.

## Step 1: Restate the Puzzle

Open by returning to the motivating question—but don't repeat the introduction verbatim.

**Restatement (preferred)**:
> "This study set out to understand how [phenomenon] shapes [outcome]. Drawing on [N] interviews with [population], we examined [focus]."

**Summary opening (alternative)**:
> "We have argued that [main claim]. Our analysis of [data] revealed [key pattern]."

**Length**: 2-3 sentences

## Step 2: Summarize Key Findings

Recap the main findings efficiently. This is NOT a rewrite of Findings or Discussion—it's a distillation.

**Enumerated**:
> "Three insights emerge. First, [finding 1]. Second, [finding 2]. Third, [finding 3]."

**Narrative**:
> "The analysis reveals that [main pattern]. This process operates through [mechanism], producing [outcome]."

**Length**: 1-2 short paragraphs (150-200 words max)

**Avoid**:
- Repeating quotes from Findings
- Restating limitations (that was Discussion)
- Introducing new findings

## Step 3: Craft the Callback

**The callback is REQUIRED** (100% of benchmark articles have them). Return to the introduction—same themes, vocabulary, or images.

**Callback strategies**:

### Echo Key Vocabulary
If intro opened with "surveillance," use "surveillance" again in conclusion.

### Return to Opening Case
If intro opened with Maria's story, return to Maria:
> "For Maria, and the mothers like her, the calculus of institutional engagement remains fraught..."

### Answer the Opening Question
If intro posed a puzzle, resolve it:
> "Intro: 'How do workers navigate contradictory demands?'"
> "Conclusion: 'Workers navigate these contradictions through what we call strategic ambiguity...'"

### Complete the Circuit
Explicitly close what the intro opened:
> "We began by noting the puzzle of [X]. We can now see that [resolution]."

**Length**: 2-3 sentences, woven into the final paragraph

## Step 4: Craft the Coda

The coda is your closing move—the last sentence(s) readers see. Make it memorable.

**Options**:

### Clinching Quote
End with a participant's words that crystallize your argument:
> As Maria put it, "It's not that we don't trust them—it's that we can't afford to."

### Mic-Drop Sentence
A declarative statement that lands:
> "What the literature calls 'exit' may be better understood as dispersal: the movement identity spreading into the broader world."

### Return to Stakes
Emphasize why this matters:
> "Understanding these dynamics is increasingly urgent as [trend] reshapes [domain]."

### Resonant Image
Leave readers with something visual:
> "The mothers we interviewed navigate a landscape of hidden tripwires, where a single misstep can trigger consequences that cascade for years."

**Avoid ending with**:
- Limitations (too weak—that was Discussion)
- "More research is needed" (generic)
- Fading repetition of findings

**Length**: 1-3 sentences

## Cluster-Specific Adjustments

### Gap-Filler
- Summary can be slightly longer (findings are the contribution)
- Coda should emphasize significance built in Discussion

### Theory-Extension
- Callback should reference the theoretical framework
- Coda may affirm framework's value

### Concept-Building
- Callback should use the new concept term
- Coda consolidates concept's utility

### Synthesis
- Callback must touch all traditions from intro
- Coda emphasizes integration achieved

### Problem-Driven
- Callback returns to real-world stakes
- Coda may escalate to policy urgency

## Output

Provide:
1. **Complete Conclusion draft** (300-500 words)
2. **Annotation** noting:
   - Opening move used (restatement/summary)
   - Where callback occurs
   - Coda type (quote/statement/stakes/image)
   - Key vocabulary echoed from introduction

## When You're Done

Return the draft to the orchestrator for Phase 4 coherence check.

**Remember**: The Conclusion is short and punchy. Don't repeat the Discussion. Close the circuit and get out.
