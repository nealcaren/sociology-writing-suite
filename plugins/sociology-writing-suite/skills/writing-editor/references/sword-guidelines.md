# Sword's Stylish Academic Writing Guidelines

Practical editing rules derived from Helen Sword's *Stylish Academic Writing*, based on analysis of 1,000 academic articles across 10 disciplines plus 100 writing guides.

- `guidelines.md` for LLM-pattern fixes (meta-commentary, triplets, symmetry)
- `becker-guidelines.md` for academic bad habits (passive voice, wordiness, abstract placeholders)

## Core Principle: Concrete Language

The single most powerful fix. Ground abstract ideas in the material world readers can see and touch.

**Before**: "The investigation of stakeholder beliefs on the topic of membership..."
**After**: "We analyzed what stakeholders believe about in-state tuition..."

Use concrete nouns, vivid verbs, sensory details, and specific examples.

---

## 1. Replace Abstract Nouns with Actors and Actions

Nominalizations (-tion, -ity, -ness, -ment) drain energy from prose.

| Abstract | Concrete |
|----------|----------|
| "The investigation of..." | "We investigated..." |
| "The development of efficacy in teams" | "How teams develop confidence" |
| "The clarification of dynamics" | "Clarifying who does what" |

**Test**: For every -tion noun, ask if a verb form is stronger.

---

## 2. Use Active Verbs, Not "Be" Verbs

Replace is/are/was/were with verbs that show action.

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Statistical methods are available" | "Researchers can apply..." |
| "It can be shown that..." | "We show that..." |
| "The theory is applicable" | "The theory applies" |

**Stylish verbs**: lurk, puzzle, fascinate, rebuff, overturn, tax, exhilarate

---

## 3. Keep Nouns and Verbs Close Together

Readers lose track when subject and verb are separated by too many words.

**Before** (23 words between subject and verb):
"The knowledge that criminalization of marijuana use can lead to a wide variety of other social ills, including an increased risk of addiction to more dangerous and expensive drugs such as heroine and cocaine, has not prevented lawmakers..."

**After**: "Lawmakers know marijuana criminalization carries risks, but they haven't changed policy."

**Rule**: Keep subject and verb within 12 words.

---

## 4. Eliminate Deictic Pronouns (It, This, That, There)

These create ambiguity and distance.

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "This shows that..." | "This finding shows..." |
| "There are many studies that..." | "Many studies show..." |
| "It is important to..." | [just do it] |

**Always pair "this" with a noun**: this argument, this finding, this pattern.

---

## 5. Use First-Person Pronouns

The myth that scientists avoid "I/we" is false. Sword's data:
- Medicine: 92% use personal pronouns
- Evolutionary biology: 100%
- Philosophy: 92%
- Literary studies: 98%

**Use "I" or "we" when**:
- Describing your methods: "We recruited 50 participants"
- Making claims: "I argue that..."
- Clarifying agency: "We designed the study to..."

---

## 6. Write Engaging Titles

Long, variable-listing titles don't increase citations.

**Avoid**: "A, B, and C in the Context of D: An Ethnographic Study Using Method X"

**Prefer**: Short, memorable, with one concrete element.

**Techniques that work**:
- Questions: "Why Do Children Die?"
- Surprising juxtaposition: "The Foreign Policy of the Calorie"
- Concrete images: "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"

---

## 7. Open with a Hook

75% of academic articles open with bland formulas. Join the 25% that hook readers.

**Hook types**:
- Opening question
- Literary or scholarly quotation
- Personal anecdote
- Historical scene-setting
- Surprising fact
- Direct address: "Consider..." "Imagine..."

**Before**: "Academic writing is increasingly acknowledged as an important area of inquiry..."

**After**: "It happened on 19th April 1964. It was bluebell time in Kent."

---

## 8. Tell a Story

Every research project contains multiple stories:
- The researcher's quest
- What you discovered
- Individual participants' experiences
- Historical context

**Transform story into plot**: Don't just report what happened—show why it happened.

**Story**: "The king died and then the queen died."
**Plot**: "The king died, and then the queen died of grief."

---

## 9. Show AND Tell

The academic version of "show, don't tell" is "show AND tell"—ground every abstract claim in concrete illustration.

**Techniques**:
- Anecdotes (miniature stories, 1-2 sentences)
- Case studies (detailed examples)
- Scenarios ("Imagine..." "Suppose...")
- Metaphors and analogies
- Visual illustrations

**Rule**: For each abstract concept, provide at least one concrete example.

---

## 10. Handle Jargon Carefully

Jargon is acceptable when it:
- Enters an ongoing scholarly conversation
- Communicates precisely with colleagues
- Creates new knowledge

Jargon is problematic when it:
- Signals membership rather than communicates
- Substitutes for thought
- Is left unexplained

**For each jargon term you keep**: Provide a gloss, historical context, or explanation.

---

## 11. Match Structure to Promise

If your opening announces four topics, your section headings must follow that order.

**Structural options**:
- **IMRAD** (Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion): Safe, rigorous
- **Hybrid**: Generic headings with unique subsections
- **Thematic**: Metaphor-driven architecture throughout

Whatever you choose, be consistent. Violating your announced structure signals shoddy thinking.

---

## 12. Cite with Style

**Problems to fix**:
- 16+ citations in one sentence → Break into multiple sentences
- Missing page numbers → Always specify
- Overquotation → Paraphrase for flow

**Read every citation aloud**. If it disrupts rhythm, relocate or rephrase.

---

## 13. Write Active Abstracts

**Before**: "The authors investigated... Implications are discussed..."

**After**: "We show that X causes Y. This challenges the assumption that..."

Include humans. Make definitive claims. Minimize hedging ("appears to," "may contribute").

---

## 14. Add Creative Touches

**Appropriate techniques**:
- Rhetorical questions to build conviction
- Metaphors that illuminate (not obscure)
- Subtle humor: wry asides, unexpected phrases
- Allusions (that work even if readers miss them)
- Passion expressed through technique, not sloppiness

**Watson & Crick's elegant understatement**: "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material."

---

## The Three Cs

1. **Communication**: Respect for audience
2. **Craft**: Respect for language
3. **Creativity**: Respect for academic endeavor

Plus three more:
- **Concreteness**: Sensory language, specific examples
- **Choice**: Deliberate decisions, not convention-following
- **Courage**: Try new techniques; rejection isn't permanent

## Quick Diagnostic

Before submitting, check:

- [ ] Can a colleague understand each sentence on first read?
- [ ] Are humans (agents, researchers, subjects) present in the writing?
- [ ] Is there at least one concrete image per paragraph?
- [ ] Do nouns and verbs sit close together?
- [ ] Did I read the opening aloud? Does it hook?
- [ ] Are page numbers included for all citations?
- [ ] Have I made deliberate choices, not just followed conventions?
