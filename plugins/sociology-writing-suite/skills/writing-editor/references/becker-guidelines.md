# Becker's Editing Guidelines

Practical editing rules derived from Howard Becker's *Writing for Social Scientists*.

- `sword-guidelines.md` for stylish writing techniques (concrete language, hooks, storytelling)

## Core Method: The Deletion Test

Remove each word or phrase. If meaning doesn't change, delete it permanently.

**Before**: "It is important to make its steps explicit so that we can see how it works."
**After**: "If we make the steps explicit, we can see how it works."

This single test catches most problems below.

---

## 1. Cut Throat-Clearing Phrases

Academic writers announce what they're about to do instead of doing it.

| Cut this | Keep this |
|----------|-----------|
| "It is important to..." | [just do it] |
| "It merits attention that..." | [state the claim] |
| "This chapter will examine..." | [examine it] |

**Rule**: If it's important, doing it makes that clear without announcement.

## 2. Name the Agent

Passive voice hides who acted. Sociological theory says people produce social life—your syntax should show them.

**Before**: "Deviants were labeled."
**After**: "Teachers labeled them as deviant."

**Before**: "Policies have been implemented."
**After**: "The district implemented new policies."

**Rule**: For each passive construction, ask: Who did this? Make that actor the subject.

---

## 3. Replace Ability Phrases with Plain Verbs

These hint at difficulty or achievement that may not exist.

| Wordy | Direct |
|-------|--------|
| "managed to maintain" | "kept" |
| "were able to" | "could" |
| "had the capability of" | "can" |

**Before**: "People who managed to maintain their dignity..."
**After**: "People who kept their dignity..."

---

## 4. Replace Abstract Placeholders with Specifics

Vague relation-words mark unfinished thinking.

| Placeholder | Ask yourself |
|-------------|--------------|
| "complex relation between" | What is the relation? |
| "a set of" | Which set? Name them. |
| "a kind of" | What kind? Be specific. |

**Before**: "There is a complex relation between class and achievement."
**After**: "Working-class children score lower because..."

---

## 5. Kill Dead Metaphors

Clichés take up space without showing readers anything new.

**Cut these**: "cutting edge," "covers terrain," "rich issue," "growing body of literature," "penetrate to the heart," "bottom line," "plant the seeds of"

**Keep metaphors that**:
- Are fresh enough to attract attention
- Are developed point-by-point (like Goffman's con game)
- Force readers to see a new aspect

**Test**: If you use a metaphor once and never again, it's dead weight.

---

## 6. Match Syntax to Logic

Coordinate clauses suggest equal importance. Use subordinate structure to show hierarchy.

**Before** (three equal clauses): "The theory is simple, it is important to make steps explicit, so we can see how it works."

**After** (if-then logic): "If we make the steps of this simple theory explicit, we can see how it works."

**Rule**: Put subordinate ideas in subordinate grammatical positions.

---

## 7. Replace Vague Qualifiers with Specific Ones

"Bullshit qualifications" protect against nothing.

**Vague**: "might possibly tend to be related under some conditions"
**Specific**: "The relationship is stronger in white populations than Black populations."

**Rule**: Real qualifications specify the exception. Vague ones are cowardly loopholes.

---

## 8. Add Concrete Details

Specific examples let readers apply general claims.

**Before**: "The change in privacy concepts..."
**After**: "Rooms in older houses had doors; modern apartments have open plans."

Without specifics, general ideas don't mean much.

---

## 9. Fix Fancy-Talk Substitutions

These work ceremonially, not semantically.

| Fancy | Plain |
|-------|-------|
| "unified stance" | "agreement" |
| "confronted the issue" | "talked about" |
| "predicated upon the availability of" | "depends on" |
| "the way in which" | "how" |

**Test**: Does the fancy version mean anything different? If no, use plain.

---

## 10. Use Literature as Components, Not Obstacles

Cite what advances your argument. Cut citations that only signal allegiance.

**Audit**: For each citation, ask: Does this author's idea do work here, or am I just name-dropping?

**Remove**: Citations of "epochal theories" used as padding.

**Keep**: Literature that provides prefabricated parts for your argument.

---

## 11. Don't Translate Into Rival Frameworks

If your argument's logic differs from the dominant approach, present it in your own terms.

**Symptom**: Feeling you can't say what you mean in the language you're using.

**Solution**: Note what different questions the established literature addresses, but don't force your answer into their terms—it will sound weak and disjointed.

---

## 12. Keep Titles Short and Unified

Long titles with variable lists and colons do NOT increase citations (Moody 2006).

**Avoid**: "A, B, and C in the Context of D: An Ethnographic Study Using Method X"
**Prefer**: "The Master Status of Addiction"

Choose one precise formulation.

---

## Editing Process

Becker's revision workflow:

1. **First pass**: Cut obvious excess words
2. **Second pass**: See what you really meant; improve phrasing
3. **Third pass**: Polish for precision
4. **Final check**: Read aloud—does syntax show logical structure?

Each pass opens the way to further changes. Clearing away nonworking words reveals what the sentence is about.

## Key Principle

> "The main lesson is not the specifics of what I have said but the Zen lesson of *paying attention.* Writers need to pay close attention to what they have written as they revise, looking at every word as if they meant it to be taken seriously."

Problems fall into identifiable classes. Once you understand the class, you know how to fix sentences belonging to it.
