# LLM Pattern Guidelines

Editing heuristics for turning LLM prose into human prose. Apply these once the ideas are sound.

See also:
- `becker-guidelines.md` for general academic writing fixes (passive voice, wordiness, abstract placeholders)
- `sword-guidelines.md` for stylish writing techniques (concrete language, hooks, storytelling)

## 1. Remove Meta-Commentary About the Writing Itself

LLMs constantly narrate what they are doing.

**LLM pattern**
> "This decision reflects a clear understanding of the reviewers' concerns."

**Human edit**
> "This decision directly addresses the reviewers' concerns."

**Rule**: If a sentence comments on *process*, *intent*, or *strategy*, ask whether the reader needs it. Usually cut or compress.

---

## 2. Replace Grand Evaluations with Specific Judgments

LLMs inflate evaluation into abstractions.

**LLM pattern**
> "This significantly enhances the manuscript's conceptual clarity and empirical rigor."

**Human edit**
> "This makes the argument easier to follow and better supported."

**Rule**: Trade *abstract virtues* (clarity, rigor, coherence, contribution) for *observable effects* (what changes for the reader).

---

## 3. Shorten Sentences Until They Feel Slightly Uneven

LLMs favor long, perfectly balanced sentences.

**LLM pattern**
> "Rather than attempting to reconcile competing frameworks, the author strategically reorients the manuscript toward its strongest empirical contributions."

**Human edit**
> "Rather than trying to reconcile competing frameworks, the author reorients the paper around its strongest empirical material."

**Rule**: Cut at least 20–30% of commas. Humans tolerate mild roughness.

---

## 4. Reduce Symmetry Across Paragraphs

LLMs love parallel structure.

**LLM pattern**
Each paragraph: First X, Second Y, Third Z.

**Human edit**
Break the pattern. Let one paragraph be shorter, more direct, or slightly messier.

**Rule**: If three paragraphs start the same way, rewrite one so it doesn't.

---

## 5. Replace Evaluative Adverbs with Plain Verbs

LLMs lean on adverbs to sound careful.

**LLM pattern**
> "The author convincingly demonstrates…"

**Human edit**
> "The author demonstrates…"

or

> "The evidence supports…"

**Rule**: Delete adverbs unless removing them changes the meaning. Most don't.

---

## 6. Prefer "Because" Over "This Reflects"

LLMs explain *why* in detached, rhetorical ways.

**LLM pattern**
> "This reflects a broader shift in the manuscript's theoretical orientation."

**Human edit**
> "Because the spatial framework is gone, the analysis now follows the interviews more closely."

**Rule**: Replace abstract reflection language with causal explanation.

---

## 7. Allow Mild Judgment Without Justification

LLMs over-justify every claim.

**LLM pattern**
> "This was the correct strategic decision, as it allowed the manuscript to avoid…"

**Human edit**
> "This was the right decision."

or

> "This strengthens the paper."

**Rule**: Humans sometimes assert judgments without footnoting their own reasoning.

---

## 8. Cut "Overall," "Importantly," and "More importantly"

Classic LLM signposts.

**LLM pattern**
> "Importantly, the author now engages with…"

**Human edit**
> "The author now engages with…"

**Rule**: If the point is important, it will sound important without being labeled.

---

## 9. Use Fewer Conceptual Nouns, More Concrete Ones

LLMs nominalize everything.

**LLM pattern**
> "The clarification of disciplinary dynamics transforms the issue into a central contribution."

**Human edit**
> "Clarifying who disciplines whom turns a confusing point into one of the paper's strengths."

**Rule**: Replace abstract nouns ending in *-tion*, *-ity*, or *-ness* with actions or actors.

---

## 10. Let Paragraphs End Without a Moral

LLMs always "land the plane."

**LLM pattern**
> "Together, these changes underscore the manuscript's contribution to…"

**Human edit**
End the paragraph after the analysis.

**Rule**: Humans often stop once the point is made. Silence reads as confidence.

---

## 11. Avoid Over-Balanced Contrast ("Not X, but Y")

LLMs love rhetorical symmetry.

**LLM pattern**
> "The paper is not merely descriptive, but analytically ambitious."

**Human edit**
> "The paper moves beyond description."

**Rule**: If a sentence has both *not* and *but*, try rewriting it with only one clause.

---

## 12. Reduce Explicit Praise When Evaluating Scholarship

LLMs sound like recommendation letters by default.

**LLM pattern**
> "This is a thoughtful, rigorous, and sophisticated analysis."

**Human edit**
> "This is a careful analysis."

or

> "The analysis is solid."

**Rule**: Academic reviewers understate. Excess enthusiasm reads as synthetic.

---

## 13. Break the "Triplet" Habit

LLMs overuse lists of three.

**LLM pattern**
> "The revision improves clarity, coherence, and empirical grounding."

**Human edit**
> "The revision improves clarity and grounding."

**Rule**: Two beats feel human. Three feels rhetorical.

---

## 14. Make At Least One Sentence Slightly Awkward

Perfect prose is suspicious.

**Example**
> "The typology works better here, and it's clearer why participants acted the way they did."

That sentence is fine but not polished. That's the point.

**Rule**: Functional prose is human.

---

## 15. Final Test: Read It Aloud

LLM prose sounds good *silently* and artificial *aloud*.

Warning signs:
- "This sounds like a report"
- "This feels over-controlled"
- "This could be a template"

---

## Summary

**Human prose sounds specific, slightly uneven, and willing to assert judgments without narrating its own cleverness.**
