## Quick Transformation Rules

1. **Name the agent**: "It has been shown" → "Smith shows"
2. **Use first person**: "Data were collected" → "We collected data"
3. **Cut throat-clearing**: "It is important to note that" → [delete]
4. **Replace vague with specific**: "Some researchers" → "Smith and Jones (2020)"
5. **Delete empty intensifiers**: "reasonably comprehensive" → "comprehensive"

### Transform These

| Avoid | Problem | Use Instead |
|-------|---------|-------------|

| "It is now generally accepted that X" | Throat-clearing | "Research confirms that X" |
| "Over the years, an enormous amount of research has been done on X" | Wordy, passive, weak verb | "Decades of research have examined X" |

## The Passive Voice Exception

Some disciplines prefer passive voice in methods sections. If required:

**Acceptable passive** (when discipline demands):
- "Participants were randomly assigned to conditions"
- "All interviews were digitally recorded"
- "Results were considered significant if p < .05"

**Still avoid** (even in passive-preferring fields):
- "It has been shown that..." (vague attribution)
- "There is evidence that..." (existential opening)
- "Research has been done on..." (weak verb)

## Key Principle

Every transformation follows one rule: **Show who did what.**

If you can't identify the agent, the sentence probably needs rewriting.
