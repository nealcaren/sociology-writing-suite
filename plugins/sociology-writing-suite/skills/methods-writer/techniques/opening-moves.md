# Opening Moves

This guide provides templates and examples for how to open Methods sections. All examples are drawn from the 77-article corpus of *Social Problems* and *Social Forces* interview studies.

**Key finding**: 88% of corpus articles use **study-led openings**—leading with the data or sample, not with methodological justification.

## Opening Types by Prevalence

| Opening Type | Prevalence | Description |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| **Study-led** | 88% | Opens with sample, data, or study description |
| **Context-led** | 6% | Opens with setting or case context |
| **Sample-led** | 4% | Opens directly with sample size |
| **Method-justified** | 2% | Opens with why interviews are appropriate |

**Recommendation**: Use study-led openings. Method-justified openings are rare and typically unnecessary.

## Study-Led Openings (88%)

### Pattern 1: Direct Data Introduction

**Formula**: "[Pronoun] [draw from / conducted / analyze] [N] [interview type] with [population]."

**Examples from corpus**:
> "I draw from 41 in-depth interviews with Black middle-class adults."

> "This paper draws on 47 in-depth, semi-structured interviews conducted in Chicago."

> "We draw from 71 multigenerational and multi-perspective in-depth interviews."

> "Data were collected as part of a larger project conducted at [site]."

**Best for**: Efficient pathway; Standard pathway without case justification need

---

### Pattern 2: Study Framing + Data

**Formula**: "[Brief conceptual or empirical frame]. [Data introduction with N, population, location/dates]."

**Examples from corpus**:
> "While the recent revival of elite studies has been dominated by economic definitions, here we draw on a wider conception that combines positional and reputational definitions. Specifically, we analyze 71 interviews from two complementary research projects about pathways to top occupational positions."

> "This study examines how guest mothers negotiate identity and dignity in shared living arrangements. I conducted 47 in-depth interviews with mothers who doubled up with family or friends in Chicago."

**Best for**: Standard pathway; articles requiring brief literature positioning

---

### Pattern 3: Temporal Framing

**Formula**: "Between [dates], [pronoun] [conducted / interviewed] [N] [population]."

**Examples from corpus**:
> "Between January 2018 and March 2020, I conducted 62 in-depth interviews with formerly incarcerated individuals."

> "From 2017 to 2019, we interviewed 89 young adults who had aged out of foster care."

**Best for**: Standard and Detailed pathways; longitudinal studies

---

### Pattern 4: Multi-Study Introduction

**Formula**: "[Study description]. [Study 1 details]. [Study 2 details]."

**Examples from corpus**:
> "This article draws on two complementary datasets. The first consists of 36 interviews conducted in the United States between 2014 and 2016. The second includes 35 interviews conducted in Denmark between 2015 and 2017."

**Best for**: Detailed pathway; comparative or merged-data designs

---

## Context-Led Openings (6%)

### When to Use
- Site characteristics are essential for interpretation
- Geographic/political context shapes the study
- Institutional setting requires explanation

### Pattern

**Formula**: "[Context description]. [Transition to data]."

**Examples from corpus**:
> "The House of Correction population is significant in its size. The vast majority of those sentenced to serve time in Massachusetts do so at the county level. In this setting, I conducted 86 interviews with detained individuals."

> "With about 2.5 million (approximately 4% of the total US immigrant population), Illinois has the fifth largest number of immigrants nationwide. In this context, we interviewed 47 undocumented parents and their children."

**Best for**: Detailed pathway; institutionally-situated studies

---

## Sample-Led Openings (4%)

### When to Use
- Sample composition is the key methodological contribution
- Sample size or characteristics are remarkable

### Pattern

**Formula**: "[Sample description, foregrounding characteristics]. [Study details follow]."

**Examples from corpus**:
> "The sample includes 140 individuals detained in the county jail on gun-related charges. All completed an interview during their detention."

> "In total, 65 youth who had been referred to diversion programs participated in interviews."

**Best for**: Detailed pathway; studies where sample access is notable

---

## Method-Justified Openings (2% - AVOID)

### Why to Avoid
- Readers assume interviews are appropriate for qualitative research questions
- Justification wastes word count
- Signals insecurity about method choice

### Examples to AVOID

**Do NOT write**:
> "Qualitative methods are appropriate for this study because they allow for in-depth exploration of meaning-making processes."

> "Interviews allow researchers to understand how participants interpret their experiences."

> "To understand the mechanisms underlying [phenomenon], I used in-depth interviews."

### Exception
Method-justified openings may be appropriate when:
- Converting from quantitative-dominant subfield
- Addressing explicit reviewer concern
- Making methodological contribution

## Opening Move Templates by Pathway

### Efficient Pathway

**Template 1**:
> "I draw from [N] [interview type] interviews with [population]."

**Template 2**:
> "This study draws on [N] interviews conducted with [population] between [dates]."

**Template 3**:
> "We conducted [N] interviews with [population] in [location]."

---

### Standard Pathway

**Template 1** (framing + data):
> "While [prior research approach], here we draw on [alternative approach]. Specifically, we analyze [N] interviews from [project description]."

**Template 2** (temporal):
> "Between [dates], I conducted [N] [interview type] interviews with [population] in [location]. This study examines [focus]."

**Template 3** (project context):
> "Data were collected as part of [broader project name/description]. I draw specifically from [N] interviews with [subgroup]."

---

### Detailed Pathway

**Template 1** (research design):
> "This study [research goal] using original, [design type] evidence from [cases/context]. The unit of analysis is [unit]. [Data description]."

**Template 2** (multi-site):
> "This article draws on two complementary datasets collected in [location A] and [location B]. The first consists of [N] interviews... The second includes [M] interviews..."

**Template 3** (context-led):
> "[Context/setting description establishing importance]. In this setting, I conducted [N] interviews with [population] between [dates]."

---

## Transition from Opening to Body

After the opening sentence(s), typical transitions include:

**To population definition**:
> "Traditionally, sociologists define [concept] through..."
> "I classify [group] as..."

**To case justification**:
> "This is an important place to study given..."
> "The [N] cases provide an ideal set of comparisons..."

**To recruitment**:
> "Participants were recruited through..."
> "I used [sampling approach], recruiting from..."

**To sample overview**:
> "In total, [N] participants were..."
> "Table 1 presents selected characteristics..."

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Burying the Sample Size
**Problem**: Sample N appears mid-paragraph or later.
**Solution**: Include N in first or second sentence.

### Mistake 2: Vague Population Description
**Problem**: "I interviewed people about their experiences."
**Solution**: Specify population clearly: "I interviewed 47 mothers who had doubled up with family or friends."

### Mistake 3: Excessive Qualification
**Problem**: "This exploratory study uses qualitative methods to begin to understand..."
**Solution**: State directly: "This study examines..."

### Mistake 4: Method Defense
**Problem**: "Interviews are appropriate because..."
**Solution**: Skip justification; lead with data.
