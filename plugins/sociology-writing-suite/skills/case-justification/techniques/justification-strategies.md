# Justification Strategies: Case Justification Sections

Every case justification section must answer the implicit question: "Why this case?" This guide presents the five justification strategies identified in the 32-article corpus.

## Overview

| Strategy | Prevalence | Best For |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Intrinsic-Interest | 38% | All clusters, especially Policy-Driven |
| Theoretical-Fit | 22% | Standard, Deep Historical |
| Empirical-Extremity | 16% | Deep Historical |
| Variation-Leverage | 16% | Comparative (signature) |
| Access-Driven | 9% | Minimal |

## Type B5: Intrinsic-Interest (38%)

The case is worth studying because it matters in its own right. The site has significance beyond its theoretical utility - it's important, notable, or consequential.

### Pattern
> "[Site] is [notable/important/significant] because [reasons]."

### Examples

**Standard Context**:
> "Kansas has a complex sociopolitical environment towards immigration."

> "Anti-immigrant rhetoric fueled the presidential election of 2016 and generated a hostile environment for Latina/o communities across the United States."

**Policy-Driven** (100% use Intrinsic-Interest):
> "The province of Ontario is especially known (or infamous) for its social assistance reform that demonstrated punitive allegiance to neo-liberal prescriptions and the resolute pursuit of market citizenship."

> "The study took place during a time of intensified frequency of deportations by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in the Obama administration."

**Deep Historical**:
> "The year 2011 was an important moment in the political history of contemporary Russia."

### When to Use
- When the case has real-world significance
- When policy relevance is central
- When the site is notable, notorious, or consequential
- In Policy-Driven sections (always)

### When to Avoid
- When the case's importance is primarily theoretical
- When variation-leverage is the real logic (use Variation-Leverage instead)

---

## Type B1: Theoretical-Fit (22%)

The case was selected because it provides ideal conditions for observing theoretical processes or testing theoretical propositions.

### Pattern
> "[Site] presents a valuable case for understanding [theoretical process] because [conditions]."

### Examples

**Standard Context**:
> "Emirati women present a valuable case for understanding how households manage earmarking under conditions where..."

> "The case illuminates therapeutic governance..."

**Deep Historical**:
> "While several accounts seeking to explain the Egyptian Uprising of 2011 begin with the killing of Khaled Said... it seems more appropriate to date the origins of this episode of collective contestation to the beginning of the new millennium."

### When to Use
- When case selection logic is explicitly theoretical
- When conditions at the site map onto theoretical processes
- When extending or testing existing theory

### When to Avoid
- When intrinsic importance is the primary logic
- In Policy-Driven sections (policy is foreground, not theory)
- In Comparative sections (use Variation-Leverage instead)

---

## Type B2: Empirical-Extremity (16%)

The case represents an extreme, deviant, or paradigmatic instance. It's significant because it's first, most, or distinctive in some empirically meaningful way.

### Pattern
> "[Site] was [the first/most significant/one of the most important] [X]."

### Examples

**Deep Historical**:
> "Nashville was one of the most significant movement centers in the overall southern civil rights struggle, and we have unusually rich data on its movement participants."

> "A latecomer in the contemporary women's movement, the U.S. anti-domestic violence movement or the 'battered women's movement' began in 1973..." [California and Minnesota as "first"]

**Comparative**:
> "Unlike King, Chavez does not require these courses for graduation and does not employ college professors to teach them."

### When to Use
- When the case is empirically distinctive
- When "first," "most," or "extreme" language applies
- In historical cases with paradigmatic status
- When data availability is unusually rich

### When to Avoid
- When the case is typical or ordinary
- When theoretical fit matters more than empirical distinction

---

## Type B3: Variation-Leverage (16%)

The comparison between sites enables analytical traction. Differences or similarities across sites allow you to isolate mechanisms or test scope conditions.

### Pattern
> "By comparing [Site A] and [Site B], we can [analytical payoff]."

### Examples

**Comparative** (signature strategy - 57% of Comparative sections):
> "By controlling for stroll type, we believe the comparison will be richer and will minimize the likelihood that other confounding variables... could serve as an alternative explanation for our findings instead of extent of gentrification."

> "Unlike King, Chavez does not require these courses for graduation and does not employ college professors to teach them."

> "Comparatively, SBR runs through Ward 7, a stroll that is also close to public transportation and a major highway, but one that has experienced almost no development or neighborhood-level change during the same period of time."

> "This move generates a dramatic change in families' residential contexts."

### When to Use
- In Comparative sections (essential)
- When site differences provide analytical leverage
- When controlling for or varying specific features
- When matched-pair or most-different logic applies

### When to Avoid
- In single-site studies (use other strategies)
- When sites are not being systematically compared

**NOTE**: This is the SIGNATURE justification for Comparative sections. It is essentially required.

---

## Type B4: Access-Driven (9%)

The case was selected because of research access - an opportunity arose to study this site. This is a candid acknowledgment that site selection was pragmatic.

### Pattern
> "We were fortunate to gain access to [site]."

### Examples

**Minimal Context**:
> "Given this interest, we were fortunate to gain access to students in a sociology course about why the gender gap in leadership exists."

**With Limitations Acknowledged**:
> "While others have interviewed young people about their gender beliefs... we sought to determine whether and why their beliefs might feasibly change."

### When to Use
- When access truly drove site selection
- In Minimal Context sections
- When extensive contextualization would misrepresent selection logic
- When paired with appropriate scope limitations

### When to Avoid
- When other justifications are available
- In longer sections where access seems insufficient
- When intrinsic importance or theoretical fit actually applies

**NOTE**: This is the rarest justification (9%) and appears primarily in Minimal Context. Use sparingly.

## Justification Strategy Distribution by Cluster

| Strategy | Minimal | Standard | Deep Historical | Comparative | Policy-Driven |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Intrinsic-Interest | 60% | 36% | 20% | 14% | **100%** |
| Theoretical-Fit | 0% | 36% | 40% | 0% | 0% |
| Empirical-Extremity | 20% | 9% | 40% | 14% | 0% |
| Variation-Leverage | 0% | 0% | 0% | **57%** | 0% |
| Access-Driven | 20% | 0% | 0% | 14% | 0% |

### Key Patterns

1. **Policy-Driven uses Intrinsic-Interest exclusively** (100%)
2. **Comparative requires Variation-Leverage** (57% - signature strategy)
3. **Deep Historical splits between Theoretical-Fit and Empirical-Extremity**
4. **Standard Context is balanced** between Intrinsic-Interest and Theoretical-Fit
5. **Access-Driven is rare** and limited to Minimal Context

## Choosing a Justification Strategy

### Decision Framework

1. **Is this a Comparative section?**
   → Variation-Leverage (required)

2. **Is this a Policy-Driven section?**
   → Intrinsic-Interest (policy matters in its own right)

3. **Is the case empirically distinctive (first, most, extreme)?**
   → Empirical-Extremity

4. **Does the case provide ideal conditions for theory?**
   → Theoretical-Fit

5. **Is the case important beyond theory?**
   → Intrinsic-Interest

6. **Was access the primary reason for site selection?**
   → Access-Driven (use sparingly, Minimal only)

### Combining Strategies

Some sections combine strategies. For example:
- Deep Historical might use both Empirical-Extremity (Nashville as significant movement center) AND Theoretical-Fit (ideal conditions for studying relational networks)
- Standard Context might use both Intrinsic-Interest (policy relevance) AND Theoretical-Fit (case illuminates process)

When combining, lead with the primary justification.

## Common Errors

### Weak Justifications to Avoid

- **"This case is interesting"** - Too vague; specify why
- **"Little research has examined X"** - This is literature gap, not case justification
- **"I had access"** - Insufficient for most sections
- **"This case is typical"** - Why not study another typical case?

### Stronger Alternatives

- **Weak**: "Portland is an interesting case."
- **Strong**: "Despite its overall demographic homogeneity, the Portland metropolitan area is home to some of the most racially diverse communities in the state of Oregon."

- **Weak**: "We had access to this organization."
- **Strong**: "Given this interest, we were fortunate to gain access to students in a sociology course about why the gender gap in leadership exists." [Note: combines access with theoretical purpose]

## Templates by Strategy

### Intrinsic-Interest Template
> "[Site/Case] is [notable characteristic]. [Evidence of significance - e.g., policy changes, public attention, scholarly debate]. This [policy/situation/context] makes [site] a [valuable/important/revealing] case for understanding [phenomenon]."

### Theoretical-Fit Template
> "[Site/Case] presents a valuable case for understanding [theoretical concept/process] because [conditions present at site]. These conditions allow us to observe [theoretical mechanism] in action."

### Empirical-Extremity Template
> "[Site/Case] was [the first/most significant/one of the most important] [empirical characteristic]. [Evidence supporting extreme status]. We have [unusually rich data/unique access] on [aspect]."

### Variation-Leverage Template
> "By comparing [Site A] and [Site B], we can examine [analytical payoff]. [Site A] provides [characteristics], while [Site B] provides [contrasting characteristics]. This variation enables us to [isolate/test/examine] [mechanism/scope condition]."

### Access-Driven Template
> "Given [research interest/theoretical concern], we gained access to [site/population]. While [appropriate scope limitation], this opportunity allowed us to examine [phenomenon]."
