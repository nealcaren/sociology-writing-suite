## When to Use This Cluster

### Primary Triggers

Use Minimal Context when ANY of the following apply:

1. **Site is well-known**: The case requires little introduction because readers are already familiar with it (e.g., major metropolitan areas, famous institutions, widely-studied phenomena).

2. **Mixed-methods design**: The qualitative component follows a quantitative analysis that has already established the case context.

3. **Phenomenon over site**: The theoretical or empirical phenomenon is more important than the specific site characteristics.

4. **Space constraints**: Article length limits require an efficient case justification.

5. **Access-driven selection**: The case was selected primarily due to data access, and extensive contextualization would misrepresent the case selection logic.

### Secondary Indicators

- You can describe the essential case features in 2-3 paragraphs
- Historical development is not analytically relevant
- No site comparisons are needed
- Policy/institutional context is either absent or minimal

## Required Components

1. **Site identification**: Name and locate the case clearly
2. **One or two key features**: What makes this case relevant?
3. **Transition to methods** (implicit or data-preview)

## Optional Components

- Brief historical note (1-2 sentences)
- Policy context (1-2 sentences)
- Access acknowledgment
- Quantitative prelude (if mixed-methods)

## Signature Moves

### Opening Patterns

**Data/Study Introduction** (most common for mixed-methods):
> "The data we present here were collected as part of a study of police traffic stops and their effects on police-community relations."

**Institutional Context**:
> "This network of colleges includes over 215,000 students, 21,000 faculty, and over two million living alumni."

**Research Setting Statement**:
> "While others have interviewed young people about their gender beliefs and show the consequences of their beliefs for inequality, we sought to determine whether and why their beliefs might feasibly change."

### Justification Patterns

**Intrinsic Interest (brief)**:
> "The study took place during a time of intensified frequency of deportations by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in the Obama administration."

**Access-Driven**:
> "Given this interest, we were fortunate to gain access to students in a sociology course about why the gender gap in leadership exists."

**Quantitative Prelude**:
> "Through statistical analyses of these data, we did not find consistent patterns of racial disparities in who gets stopped citywide... However, we did find significant disparities in several post-stop outcomes."

### Transition Patterns

**Data-Preview** (20%):
> "While the focus of this paper is on the analysis of the interview data, some findings from the survey of staff will be included."

**Implicit** (60%):
Section ends; methods section follows immediately.

## Prohibited Moves

Minimal Context sections should NEVER:

1. **Include tables** - Tables signal Comparative treatment
2. **Trace historical development** - Chronological narratives belong in Deep Historical
3. **Use multiple subsections** - One subsection maximum
4. **Exceed 500 words** - If longer, reconsider Standard Context
5. **Position before theory** - Policy-Driven only
6. **Elaborate policy context** - Keep it brief or omit

## Template Structure

### Single-Paragraph Template (Ultra-Minimal)
```
[1 paragraph: Site identification + key feature + quantitative/access context + brief transition]
```

### Two-Paragraph Template (Standard Minimal)
```
Paragraph 1: Site identification and one key contextual feature
Paragraph 2: Additional context (timing, access, quantitative findings) + transition
```

### Three-Paragraph Template (Extended Minimal)
```
Paragraph 1: Site identification and primary feature
Paragraph 2: Secondary context (policy OR history OR institutional)
Paragraph 3: Brief transition or methods preview
```

## Exemplar Articles

### Primary Exemplar: Police Traffic Stops Study

**Why exemplar**: At 264 words in a single paragraph, this is the corpus minimum. Establishes the San Diego Police Department study, mentions the quantitative analysis that preceded qualitative interviews, and moves directly to data.

**Key features**:
- Single paragraph (1 paragraph)
- 264 words
- 2 citations
- Data-Preview transition
- Mixed-methods framing

**Opening**: "The data we present here were collected as part of a study of police traffic stops and their effects on police-community relations."

### Secondary Exemplar: Undocumented Students at Jesuit Colleges

**Why exemplar**: Brief institutional context for a network of colleges, establishing mission and policy environment efficiently.

**Key features**:
- 2 paragraphs
- ~320 words
- 6 citations
- Institutional + policy context
- Implicit transition

**Opening**: "This network of colleges includes over 215,000 students, 21,000 faculty, and over two million living alumni."

### Tertiary Exemplar: Gender Beliefs Course Study

**Why exemplar**: Demonstrates the Access-Driven variant. Explicitly acknowledges access opportunity and sample limitations.

**Key features**:
- 3 paragraphs
- ~422 words
- 3 citations
- Research-Setting opening
- Access acknowledgment

**Opening**: "While others have interviewed young people about their gender beliefs and show the consequences of their beliefs for inequality, we sought to determine whether and why their beliefs might feasibly change."

## Calibration Checklist

Before submitting a Minimal Context section, verify:

- [ ] Word count is 300-500 words
- [ ] No more than 3 paragraphs
- [ ] No tables included
- [ ] No extended historical narrative
- [ ] One subsection at most
- [ ] Positioned after theory section
- [ ] Essential case features are clear
- [ ] Transition to methods is present (implicit or explicit)

### If your section exceeds 500 words:
Consider whether you actually need **Standard Context**. Ask:
- Am I including geographic context that readers need?
- Am I providing historical background that matters analytically?
- Would my case benefit from fuller contextualization?

If yes to any, upgrade to Standard Context.
