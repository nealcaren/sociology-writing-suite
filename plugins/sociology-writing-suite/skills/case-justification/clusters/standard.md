## When to Use This Cluster

### Primary Triggers

Use Standard Context when ALL of the following apply:

1. **Single research site**: You are studying one location, organization, or case (not comparing multiple sites).

2. **Moderate contextualization needed**: The case requires more than minimal introduction but does not require extensive historical narrative.

3. **Theory drives site selection**: The case was chosen because it provides conditions where theoretical processes can be observed (Theoretical-Fit) or because it matters in its own right (Intrinsic-Interest).

4. **Standard research design**: Not a comparative design, not a policy study that must precede theory, not a movement study requiring historical periodization.

### Secondary Indicators

- Geographic, historical, or policy dimensions need to be established
- Case is not widely known to readers
- Historical context is background, not foreground
- 3-7 paragraphs are sufficient to establish context

**Standard Context is the DEFAULT cluster**. Use it when other clusters don't apply.

## Signature Moves

### Opening Patterns

**Geographic Introduction** (27% - signature for this cluster):
> "Kansas is a re-emerging destination for Latina/o immigrants."

> "The UAE is a small Islamic federation of nearly ten million residents in the Arab Gulf."

**Phenomenon-Site Link** (45%):
> "With the formalization of a labor-export policy in the mid-1970s, the Indonesian government entered the labor brokerage industry."

> "Ghostwriting is not a new form of work."

### Justification Patterns

**Theoretical Fit** (36%):
> "Emirati women present a valuable case for understanding how households manage earmarking under conditions where..."

> "The case illuminates therapeutic governance..."

**Intrinsic Interest** (36%):
> "Kansas has a complex sociopolitical environment towards immigration."

> "Anti-immigrant rhetoric fueled the presidential election of 2016 and generated a hostile environment for Latina/o communities across the United States."

### Content Development Patterns

**Historical thread**:
> "The railroad industry brought Mexican immigrants to the state at the turn of the 20th century."

**Demographic statistics**:
> "In 2000, seven percent of the state's population was Latina/o and by 2017 this rose to over 11 percent, of whom 34 percent were foreign born."

**Policy context**:
> "In 2004 undocumented college students gained in-state tuition. However, in the same period the state denied undocumented immigrants access to driver's licenses..."

### Transition Patterns

**Implicit** (73% - most common):
Section ends; Methods follows. No explicit transition needed.

> "This anti-immigrant context emerges from a long history of immigration policies that criminalize undocumented migration and racialize illegality, linking stereotypes of Mexican origin to perceptions of illegality."

## Prohibited Moves

Standard Context sections should AVOID:

1. **Multiple subsections** - Use only one subsection heading
2. **Chronological narratives** - If tracing multiple episodes, use Deep Historical
3. **Comparison tables** - Tables signal Comparative treatment
4. **Position before theory** - That signals Policy-Driven
5. **Extensive historical development** - More than 3 paragraphs of history suggests Deep Historical
6. **Access-driven justification** - This is rare and suggests Minimal

## Template Structure

### Standard Template (5 paragraphs)

```
## [Site Name Context]

Paragraph 1: Geographic introduction and site identification
- Name the location
- Key geographic features
- Position within broader region

Paragraph 2: Historical background
- Brief history (not chronological narrative)
- How we got to the present
- 1-2 sentences on historical roots

Paragraph 3: Demographic and/or institutional context
- Population statistics
- Key institutional features
- Who lives/works there

Paragraph 4: Policy and/or legal context

### Longer Template (6-7 paragraphs)

```
## [Site Name Context]

Paragraph 1: Geographic introduction

Paragraph 2: Historical background

## Exemplar Articles

### Primary Exemplar: Kansas Latino Immigration

**Why exemplar**: Demonstrates the standard template well. Opens with geographic introduction, provides historical and demographic context, addresses policy environment, and establishes why Kansas is a suitable site for theoretical inquiry.

## Calibration Checklist

Before submitting a Standard Context section, verify:

- [ ] Word count is 700-1,000 words
- [ ] 3-7 paragraphs present
- [ ] Exactly one subsection heading
- [ ] At least two of the contextual trifecta included (geographic/historical/policy)
- [ ] Case significance is clear
- [ ] Positioned after theory section
- [ ] No comparison tables
- [ ] No extended chronological narrative (more than 3 paragraphs)
- [ ] Implicit or bridge transition present

### If your section exceeds 1,200 words:
Consider whether you need:
- **Deep Historical** (if historical development is central)
- **Comparative** (if describing multiple sites)
- **Policy-Driven** (if policy context should precede theory)

### If your section is under 600 words:
Consider whether:
- **Minimal Context** would suffice (well-known site, mixed-methods prelude)
- You need to add geographic, historical, or policy context

### If you have multiple sites:
You need **Comparative**, not Standard Context.
