# Reading Agent Prompt Template

Use this prompt template when spawning a haiku reading agent for structured note-taking. This integrates with the lit-synthesis skill's Phase 1: Deep Reading (Docling mode).

## Prerequisites

1. **Convert PDF to markdown**:
```bash
./pdf-to-md.sh "/path/to/paper.pdf"
# Returns: /path/to/paper.md
```

2. **Gather identifiers** (at least one required):
   - OpenAlex work ID (e.g., `W2123456789`) - from lit-search database
   - DOI (e.g., `10.1086/123456`)
   - Zotero item key (e.g., `ABC123XY`)

## Prompt Template

```
You are a research assistant creating structured reading notes for a sociology literature synthesis project.

## Paper Identifiers
- OpenAlex ID: {openalex_id}
- DOI: {doi}
- Zotero Key: {zotero_key}
- PDF source: {pdf_path}

## Paper Content
{markdown_content}

## Instructions

Create reading notes in this exact format, starting with the required YAML frontmatter:

---
openalex_id: {openalex_id}
doi: {doi}
zotero_key: {zotero_key}
first_author: [extract from paper]
year: [extract from paper]
short_title: [2-3 word slug derived from title]
---

# [FirstAuthor Year] - [Short Title]

## Bibliographic Info
- **Authors**: [extract all authors]
- **Year**: [publication year]
- **Title**: [full title]
- **Journal**: [venue/publisher]
- **DOI**: [as link if available]
- **OpenAlex**: https://openalex.org/{openalex_id}

## Core Argument
[1-2 sentences: What is the paper arguing?]

## Theoretical Framework
- **Tradition**: [e.g., Bourdieusian, institutionalist, interactionist, framing theory]
- **Key concepts**: [list main theoretical concepts used]
- **Theory deployment**: [description | extension | critique | synthesis]

## Empirical Strategy
- **Data**: [what kind of data - interviews, content analysis, survey, etc.]
- **Methods**: [how data was analyzed]
- **Sample**: [who/what was studied, N if applicable]

## Key Findings
1. [Finding 1]
2. [Finding 2]
3. [Finding 3]

## Contribution Claim
[What does the paper claim to contribute to the literature?]

## Limitations
[As noted by the authors]

## Key Quotes
> "[Quote 1 - captures core argument or key concept]" (p. X)

> "[Quote 2 - methodological or theoretical insight]" (p. Y)

> "[Quote 3 - finding or implication]" (p. Z)

## Connections
[What other papers, concepts, or debates does this connect to?]

## Analytical Notes
[Your observations: How is the argument constructed? What assumptions underlie it? How does this relate to the broader project?]

```

## Usage with Task Tool

Spawn a haiku agent with the populated prompt:

```
Task tool parameters:
- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- model: "haiku"
- prompt: [reading prompt with markdown content and identifiers filled in]
- description: "Read paper: AuthorYear"
```

## Batch Processing

For multiple papers:

1. Convert all PDFs to markdown (cached)
2. Prepare identifier list from lit-search database
3. Spawn multiple haiku agents in parallel
4. Save outputs to `reading-notes/author-year-slug.md`

## Integration with lit-synthesis

These notes feed directly into lit-synthesis:
- **Phase 2**: Theoretical mapping uses the "Tradition" and "Key concepts" fields
- **Phase 3**: Thematic clustering uses findings and methods
- **Phase 4**: Debate mapping uses "Connections" and "Analytical Notes"
- **Phase 5**: Field synthesis draws on all sections

The frontmatter identifiers enable reliable matching back to source papers through the entire workflow.
