# Phase 4: Debate Mapping

## Why This Phase Matters

Debates are opportunities. Where scholars disagree—about mechanisms, explanations, definitions, or evidence—there's space for contribution. This phase identifies the tensions, contradictions, and unresolved questions in your field.

For argument-builder, debates may suggest a Problem-Driven (Debate-Resolver) cluster, or they may reveal productive tensions to address even in other cluster types.

## Your Tasks

### 1. Identify Explicit Disagreements

Look for papers that directly critique each other:
- Paper A cites Paper B critically
- Paper A claims to "correct" or "extend" Paper B
- Paper A and Paper B reach opposite conclusions

**Signals of explicit disagreement**:
- "Contrary to [Author]..."
- "[Author]'s approach overlooks..."
- "We depart from [Author]..."
- "Unlike [Author], we find..."

### 2. Identify Implicit Tensions

Look for contradictions that aren't acknowledged:
- Papers with incompatible findings
- Papers using the same concept differently
- Papers with incompatible underlying assumptions

**Types of implicit tension**:
- **Empirical**: Paper A finds X, Paper B finds not-X
- **Theoretical**: Paper A assumes mechanism M, Paper B assumes mechanism N
- **Definitional**: Paper A defines concept as X, Paper B as Y
- **Scope**: Paper A claims generality, Paper B claims contingency

### 3. Document Each Debate

For each tension identified:

```markdown
## Debate: [Short Name]

### The Tension
[One-sentence summary of what's at stake]

### Position 1
- **Claim**: [What this side argues]
- **Key papers**: [Authors]
- **Evidence**: [What supports this position]
- **Underlying assumption**: [What must be true for this to hold]

### Position 2
- **Claim**: [What this side argues]
- **Key papers**: [Authors]
- **Evidence**: [What supports this position]
- **Underlying assumption**: [What must be true for this to hold]

### State of the Debate
- **Is this resolved?**: [Yes/No/Partially]
- **What would resolve it?**: [Type of evidence or analysis needed]
- **Why it matters**: [Stakes for the field]

### Relevance to Your Project
[How does your research speak to this debate?]
```

### 4. Map Unresolved Questions

Beyond bilateral debates, identify open questions:
- Questions papers raise but don't answer
- Questions in "future research" sections
- Questions implied by limitations

```markdown
## Unresolved Questions

### Question 1: [Formulation]
- **Raised by**: [Papers]
- **Why unresolved**: [What would it take to answer?]
- **Relevance**: [Does your project address this?]
```

### 5. Identify Contested Concepts

Some concepts are themselves sites of debate:
- Different definitions in circulation
- Different operationalizations
- Different theoretical homes

```markdown
## Contested Concept: [Name]

### Definition Variants
| Author | Definition | Tradition |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| [A] | "[definition]" | [tradition] |
| [B] | "[definition]" | [tradition] |

### Why This Matters
[What's at stake in how the concept is defined?]

### Your Position
[How will you define/use this concept?]
```

### 6. Write Debate Map

Create `debate-map.md`:

```markdown
# Debate Map

## Overview

This field contains [N] identifiable debates and [N] unresolved questions.

**Major debates**:
1. [Debate 1 name]
2. [Debate 2 name]
3. [Debate 3 name]

## Debate 1: [Name]

[Full documentation using template above]

## Debate 2: [Name]

[Full documentation]

## Debate 3: [Name]

[Full documentation]

## Unresolved Questions

1. **[Question 1]**
   - Raised by: [papers]
   - What would answer it: [description]

2. **[Question 2]**
   - Raised by: [papers]
   - What would answer it: [description]

## Contested Concepts

### [Concept 1]
[Documentation using template]

### [Concept 2]
[Documentation using template]

## Implications for Your Project

### Debates You Could Adjudicate
- [Debate X]: Your data could show [how]

### Questions You Could Address
- [Question Y]: Your project directly addresses this

### Positions You'll Take
- On [Debate Z]: You align with [Position] because [reason]

### Lit-Writeup Implications
- **If adjudicating a debate**: Use Problem-Driven (Debate) cluster
- **If taking a side**: Cite both positions, then align
- **If neither**: Note the debate but don't center it
```

## Guiding Principles

### Not Every Tension Is a Debate
Some differences are just different. A debate exists when scholars are actually in disagreement about something that matters.

### Implicit Tensions Are Often More Important
Explicit debates are easy to find. The interesting ones are often unacknowledged contradictions.

### Debates Create Contribution Space
If everyone agrees, there's nothing to add. If there's disagreement, your evidence can move the conversation.

### You Don't Have to Resolve Every Debate
Note debates, but focus on ones your project actually speaks to.

### Fairness Matters
If you're documenting a debate, present both sides fairly—even if you'll eventually take a side.

## Output Files to Create

1. **debate-map.md** - Full documentation of debates and tensions

---

## When You're Done

Report to the orchestrator:
- Number of debates identified
- Number of unresolved questions
- Key contested concepts
- Debates relevant to user's project
- Recommendation on whether Problem-Driven cluster is appropriate

Example summary:
> "Debate mapping complete. **3 major debates** identified: (1) structural vs. cultural explanations for legal cynicism, (2) whether police-calling indicates trust or desperation, (3) role of neighborhood context vs. individual disposition. **5 unresolved questions** documented. Key contested concept: 'cynicism' has 3 distinct definitions in circulation. User's project directly addresses Debate 2—recommend considering **Problem-Driven (Debate)** cluster if adjudicating, or noting the debate in a Gap-Filler turn. Ready for Phase 5."
